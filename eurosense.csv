When I left my country for my studies, towards more rich and culturally diverse areas of Europe, I found reliefing that I could see people from different backgrounds, probably immigrants, well integrated in society. As my territory is indeed facing strong demographic struggles, which is one of the topic that most concerns me about my territory (and Europe overall), seeing an apparently effective immigration policy is something that gives me hope and makes me push towards trying to adopt such things all over in Europe. However, people's feelings in Europe are not that positive about immigration, which to me is really counterintuitive for the future of Europe.",Immigration as a needed resource,,,,,1,1,,,,1,,,,,Positive,0.9,0.09999999999999998,0.9,,0.37,0.63,0.37,,,,,1,0.63,0.37,0.63,,0.3656250953674317,0.05129642623791597,0.051296426237915964,0.6087266915136103,0.3399768822484737,,0.6875000953674316,0.30669208224728806,0.30669208224728806,0.15915386350892435,0.5341540542437876,,0.3218750953674316,0.4074115615954502,0.4074115615954502,0.4744191238348433,0.11816931456970646,,0.6093750953674316,0.1879870462760651,0.1879870462760651,0.29663138149453594,0.5153815722293991,,0.4567936444189894,0.6000501389780166,0.2788515748630665,0.8488319517709118,,,,,People,Are you aware of the deep demographic crisis and how do you indend facing it while keeping european standards of life high and with a perspective of growth,somewhat common,Germany,,16 - 24,Male,"Everybody, the public",188,,,1715275186969,Chrome,1715276106090,WebCollector 2.4,124,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RBcontacts
