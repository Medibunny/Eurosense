She voted Volt for the national election, she is progressive, keeps up (from a distance) with geopolitical events, is social etc. However, in the days of the election and afterwards, she saw a bunch of small videos on social media, after which I had (for me) a very weird, alienating conversation with her. She said that she saw Geert Wilders (ultranationalist) on Nieuwsuur (serious intellectual tv show) and that she thought he was a very reasonable guy, that she was happy that he would finally take the drama out of political debate, and just sit down with people and FINALLY come up with solutions for the country. Turns out she saw some very smartly cut out (populist) videos, and she never really heard any speeches from the guy. It is like history of the last 20 years of hateful speeches was just completely not there anymore. To me this was a very alienating feeling, trying to tell her what this guys ideology actually is, but I could not convince her...

Our garden was paved when we bought our house 15 years ago, but we were not aware that we were obliged to use this as parking spot. Also the real estate agent did not inform us about this. It turned out I had to make an official objection to this 'parking place on own premises' and that this would take at least 2 months. After that we could possibly arrange the parking permit. Duration: approx 1-2 months. Meanwhile I have to search for parking spots in the neighbourhood where a parking permit is not required. Bothering other people in their parking possibilities. While I really just want to pay for a permit in the neighbourhood of my house.  Why is the municipality so slow in deciding to give me a permit?

Because my father, a conservative man, psychologically abused my mother and me for our gender, and finances were one of his bigger weapons. 
He, aside from more pshycologically based abuses, like conditional love or strictness and control and isolating us, convinced my mother women could not handle money, a belief that was then passed to me. ""The man handles the money. Women are bad with money"". He would spend my mothers money, when she earned more than him. But not let her learn about or do taxes on her own. He would choose insurances, banks to open accounts in, investments, without consulting her, and always said and assumed that, until I was married, he could just do the same with me. 

I still have anxiety attacks when I do expensive purchases or handle my IRS, I also have panic attacks when I start searching for house loans or ways to invest in real state, so I can buy a house. Because it was induced in me this idea of ""if you try, it will go wrong, you will loose all your money and live in the streets"". Something he would repeat often. 

Did you know that there are cases of financial bullying, coersion, coerced debt, damaged credit scores, and deep correlations between womens lack of financial literacy and the amount of time women will stay in abusive relationships? The data exists. 

One of the reasons I cannot trust the far-left on this topic, is that leftist forces, like portuguese party Bloco de Esquerda (left block) have correlated financial literacy as a capitalist trap that makes people do bad decisions, almost calling it a ""liberal"" conspiracy to promote capitalist think tanks and ideas. How can a party that is supposedly pro social-justice ever present themselves as feminist and pro working class defend such a statement? On the other side of the spectrum, conservative political groups just want the women to return to more traditional roles, leaving these situations more open to become the norm. 

If you are truly a feminist, you will defend  the hability of women to financially protect themselves from any kind of financial abuse. Not shame them from engaging in this type of education, for the sake of protecting a supposed anti-capitalist utopia you have as a goal to construct. If not for ideological reasons, do it for pragmatic ones. The anti-capitalist utopia will not come in our lifetime, if ever, but there are women being convinced they are financially unstable and abused by the men in their lives right now. And not just women, anyone with lack of financial literacy is more prone to make bad decision with their money. Not everyone can precisely throw their money at a personal assistant or consultant to gain or not loose money. And leaves them more vulnerable to any miracle worker that tells them how to get rich quick. If you truly are for feminism, you will teach them to have a positive relationship with money and teach them how to handle it alone. 

This is where Volt can make a difference. Differenciate from other parties that fall under this trap. Don't run away from the idea that money and grow personal wealth can be a positive thing. And pass the message that women can do it as well as men. Not for the purpose of getting rich, but for the purpose of being free from an actual form of patriarchy.

Aktuell bin ich in Integrationskursen aktiv und sehe die krassen Vertrauensbrüche in etablierten demokratischen Systemen. Gerade weil ich spüre, dass die Fähigkeiten zur persönlichen Integrität der Bürger:innen in den einzelnen europäischen Ländern zu Wünschen und Hoffen lässt, sind die Projektionen auf die Schwierigkeiten mit Migration und Integration, das Unverständnis klimatisch bedingter Katastrophen, Kriegspropaganda u.v.m. nur Ablenkung von globalen Herausforderungen für uns Europäer:innen. Darum suche ich Lösungen in integraler Politik und möchte meinen Beitrag leisten, zurzeit mit der Konzeptentwicklung integraler Bildungsansatzes mit Relevanz im politischen Raum.","Gemeinsamkeiten in unterschiedlichen Perspektiven austauschen, bewusst entwickeln und von der Zukunft her co-creativ einleiten",,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,Positive,0.87,,,,0.61,,,,0.66,,,,0.87,,,,0.303125,0.17719570681345553,0.1771957068134555,0.6082771465932723,0.2145271465932722,,0.50625,0.37863466550977964,0.3786346655097796,0.3044326672451102,0.31693266724511016,,0.50625,0.659210205078125,0.659210205078125,0.16414489746093752,0.17664489746093748,,0.334375,0.30669210969115335,0.30669210969115335,0.5122789451544234,0.1810289451544233,,0.6540023014572285,0.5982879258551341,0.4260441259735842,0.8566302294073408,,"eine Idee; noch zu starke einseitige ""Wirtschaftsunion""; Konglomerat verschiedener Kulturen, deren gemeinsamen Wurzeln unerkannt und wenig geachtet werden...",eine enorme politische Chance für evolutionäre Entwicklung,"eine alte Dame, die ihr wahres Potential noch nicht voll ausgeschöpft hat und die offen für Transformation für ihre Enkel ist","Die Geschichte kann ich noch nicht sehr publikumswirksam erzählen, ich arbeite noch dran.","Unter welchen Struktur- und Systemzwängen leiden Sie selbst, wenn Sie ehrlich sein können?",very common,Germany,,Female,over 65 ,,I consent to the processing of my data under the privacy policy of Volt Europa A.I.S.B.L. ,294,,,,1724485124613,Chrome,1724488274252,WebCollector 2.4,127,de,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,voltsense,,true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Veel zo niet alle telefoonnummers op websites van leveranciers en overheid zijn gewoon verdwenen. De namen van de functionarissen en hun bazen zijn ook plotseling allemaal verdwenen. Gelaten wordt dit door de meeste mensen allemaal maar geaccepteerd.  Je kunt niemand meer verantwoordelijk stellen. Je praat meer en meer tegen systemen met beperkte functionaliteit. De tijd die je verliest als klant of burger wordt als normaal beschouwd.  Terwijl de winsten van de bedrijven (leveranciers) verder oplopen. Ook bij de overheid loopt je meer en meer  tegen dit soort mechanismen aan. 
Het wordt tijd voor een wet die het recht op contact en menselijk contact definieert voordat we straks alleen nog maar tegen chatbots , en AI systemen praten.

Our goal is to create a safe space of understanding that offers room for diverging feelings and narratives - in a time when there are few spaces where people feel like they can share their fear, anger, despair, and hope openly - without being misunderstood or attacked. The group is an attempt to not let our communities in Switzerland be drawn into division in the face of all the unspeakable violence in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. This groups is one of the few places where I feel I can breathe. Where there is room for the complexity of lives, narratives, collective identities. And mostly pain. There is so much pain that festers in people as long as they cannot share it and as long as they feel they aren't seen. Every meeting we've had is a small universe in itself. Calm, deep, sad, and hopeful. After each meeting I leave the room both heavier and lighter. Heavier as I start to understand more perspectives on the unspeakable violence and suffering. Lighter as I see that there are wonderful people dedicated to coming tother and emphasising the holiness of life and solidarity to each others' humanity - without forgetting their particular identities.",Every life is a universe,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,Very positive ,0.34,,,,0.78,,,,0.08,,,,,,,1,0.58125,0.18438062050359716,0.18438062050359716,0.32655968974820127,0.48905968974820146,,0.50625,0.5404957284172662,0.5404957284172662,0.2235021357913668,0.23600213579136686,,0.471875,0.6807834982014389,0.6807834982014388,0.1877332508992806,0.13148325089928053,,0.0625,0.05128709532374098,0.05128709532374098,0.9118564523381296,0.03685645233812951,,0.2060810810810811,0.7929393764110985,0.2668918918918919,0.838318437109324,,An attempt to move beyond nation-states as the main mode of governance.

Wir besprechen gerade im Umfeld, wieso es so schwierig ist, in der Politik entsprechende Mehrheiten zu gewinnen, obwohl doch Anfang des Jahres genau dafür so unglaublich viele Menschen (über eine Millionen) überall im Land dafür auf den Strassen waren.
Darüber hinaus entsteht natürlich die Frage nach Möglichkeiten der Beteiligung. So ein Engagement der Bevölkerung auf der einen Seite unter Beteiligung vieler Politiker:innen, Beschwörung des zivilgesellschaftlichen Engagements und dann verpufft das Ganze in der zögerlichen Tatenlosigkeit der Berufspolitik.
Die Wirksamkeit des persönlichen Engagements rutscht so natürlich gefühlt ins deprimierende Minus. Die Frage bei so vielen Themen dieser Tage lautet also wieder: wie motiviert, wie hoffnungsvoll bleiben?

positiv hingegen ist die Meldung, dass der Zuwachs der erneuerbaren Energien (PV) im Wesentlichen von Privathaushalten getragen wird (auch in Bayern).

They hired an engineering firm to explain topics such as 'climate neutral' and 'energy neutral'.

After introducing climate neutral, it was mentioned the city is responsible for emissions from ships that fare the rivers. Somebody said those emissions were already compensated by national solar and wind energy parks. Therefore, the muncipality does not have to compensate those emissions. As a response, the speaker tried to explain that it does not matter how it is compensated (national or in the muncipality), the muncipality just hast to provide reasoning for it.

I felt helpless as I thought: why are we bickering over CO2 budgets, when this is about ecological overshoot, the breaching of 6 out of 9 planetary boundaries? The warming build in the pipeline has too big of a momentum to stop, and climate chang is just one of the factors.

In the news, a long queue of university students was being reported, waiting for a meeting with a housing agency. Through the meeting, the students would access the opportunity to rent a room or a flat with their friends during the year, in order to attend the university.

The prices are totally disproportionate, the flats are small and often with poor living standards, and young students were peacefully waiting for a meeting with the agency, looking at their phones, totally alienated from their reality. I am certain that most of them know and care about the unfairness of the system, that brings workers (their parents or them) to devote most of their working hours to keep enriching landowners, often constituted as societies with multiple properties, often international companies, with no other purpose than to live off the work of others. 

The DOCILITY of university students (as myself!), which is supposed to be the most politically active group in the society, left me astonished. Why weren't housing agencies being brought down to flames all over the country? Wouldn't that be the expected response from university students under these conditions? If students do not raise their voices now, what are we to expect from the future?

Der progressive Teil muss den konservativen einbinden und mitnehmen - der konservative Teil sollte lernen das Kritik anausgrenzenden Haltungen und nicht nachhaltigen Lebensweisen nicht als Angriff auf den eigenen Lebenstil ist, sondern zum Nachdenken auffordert (die Kritik sollte aber auch entsprechend formuliert werden).
Wir müssen lernen miteinander zu lernen und Politik muss authentisch und transparent werden. Die Gesellschaft sieht das vielfach Versprechen gebrochen werden und Fehlverhalten keine Konsequenzen folgt. Auch unliebsame erforderliche Entscheidungen werden von oben herab ohne die Einbindung der Betroffenen getroffen.

Avendo preso appuntamento attraverso il fascicolo sanitario ( dove compare la prescrizione del medico di base, condizione sine qua non per avere l’appuntamento) e essendo munita di foglio sia di regione Lombardia sia dell’ospedale che attestavano il mio appuntamento, sono rimasta sorpresa quando all’accettazione ho scoperto che senza prescrizione scritta cartacea da consegnare al momento, non avrei potuto fare l’esame. 
Esame prenotato UN anno fa. Con una ricetta di un anno fa che ovviamente non avevo più. O chissà dov’era.. 
Ero convinta che tutto fosse online: l’appuntamento me l’hanno dato perché c’era la ricetta medica. 
Quindi perché doverlo “ri” produrre?
Perché tutto il sistema sanitario non dico di tutto il paese ( magari!) ma almeno della regione? Della città! Perché non è in rete? Che ci serve l’AI se non possiamo o non siamo capaci di mettere in connessione questi dati? Più che volare in avanti ( che ci schiantiamo) varrebbe la pena siatemare le basi.

Met 22 deelnemende studenten van verschillende achtergronden, 7 verschillende nationaliteiten en van verschillend niveau (MBO, HBO en WO), werkten we aan vijf echte challenges uit de regio. De challenges hebben allemaal te maken met de SDG's en in multi-disciplinaire teams werkten de studenten gedurende een week aan deze opdrachten. Aan het einde van de week presenteerden ze hun ideeën voor een professionele jury in het kasteel van Mértola, aan de Guadiana rivier in Portugal.
Wij waren de organisatoren én de hosts voor deze groep studenten, die elkaar vrijwel allemaal voor het eerst ontmoetten, maar werden verbonden door de wil om impact te maken, iets bijzonders mee te maken. We zagen vriendschappen ontstaan en mensen werden geraakt door de inspirerende energie en inzichten van alle deelnemers. Ongeacht afkomst, achtergrond of opleiding. 
En het mooie is, dat de ideeen ook echt een vervolg krijgen: in november organiseren we een bijeenkomst voor de Challenge Owners, waarin we gaan bespreken welke ideeen een vervolg gaan krijgen, en hoe we elkaar daarin kunnen helpen.","De internationale SDG Challenge in Portugal: vriendschap, inspiratie en impact gaan hand in hand!",,,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,Very positive ,0.85,,,,0.67,,,,0.51,,,,0.5,,,,0.309375,0.23836555755395683,0.23836555755395683,0.5714422212230216,0.1901922212230216,,0.509375,0.3390849820143885,0.3390849820143885,0.32108250899280577,0.33983250899280576,,0.378125,0.5549123201438849,0.5549123201438849,0.34441883992805755,0.10066883992805753,,0.565625,0.2851281474820144,0.2851281474820144,0.29181092625899274,0.42306092625899283,,0.6317567567567568,0.8502602951878044,0.5827702702702703,0.36780922881719624,,Een noodzakelijke droom,"Een ingewikkeld, prachtig onderdeel van de wereld","relevant, belangrijk, het verdedigen waard, niet altijd de beste vorm","Jongeren, studenten, onderwijsinstellingen, bedrijven, overheden","Investeer in de toekomst, durf en inspireer.

Sei es mein Chef, der auch wenn er gern eine moderne Sichtweise auf das Miteinander im Job hat, aber nur Mitarbeiterinnen (den Werkstudenten mal ausgenommen) hat und sich auf cholerische Art an einer Kollegin abarbeitet, sie defamiert und bis zu den Tränen bringt; ein offenes (auch Frauen gegenüber) Miteinander schafft er oft nicht und selbst ich selbst, die gern auf allen Gebieten auf dem neuesten bleiben muss, und sich eingestehen muss, dass man nicht alles im Auge behalten kann. Instagram und  die Sozialen Medien ballern uns zu mit Informationen, die wir gar nicht mehr verarbeitet kriegen und machen süchtig. Ich bin froh, dass wir in einer Zeit leben, in der auf vieles gezeigt wird und viel aufgedeckt wird, aber mir macht Angst, wie die politischen Lager sich daran hochziehen und die Themen im negativem Sinn für sich nutzen und die breite Masse einfach unbeweglich und ohne Regung zuschaut. Jane Goodall sagt -  Think globally, act locally - und das finde ich sehr richtig. Was aber wenn so viele sich einfach herausnehmen. Ich versuche schon zu intervenieren.

Die Situationen waren belastend, individuell und sozial bedrohlich und die Verfassung ist für Rechtsfaschismus außer Kraft gesetzt wurden. Menschen äußerten sich in der Arbeitsorganisation und auch außerhalb massiv pro AFD, machten Hitlergrüße und ich wurde sehr damit gestalkt und belästigt.

Die Bewerbungsphase gab schon diverse Indizien dafür, dass massiver Betrug und anderes kriminelles für Faschismus betrieben wird und die ersten Gespräche oder Versuche bei Vorgesetzten um Unterstützung zu bitten haben diesen Betrug für andere Kriminalitäten später auch bestätigt.

Obwohl die Führungskräfte mehrfach erklärt haben, dass sie selbst Rechtsextremismus und Kriminalitäten für Faschismus nicht unterstützen, so wurde hintenrum weiter dafür organisiert und gehandelt. Die Belästigungen und Belastungen dazu hörten bis zur Kündigung nicht auf.

Fazit: kein Arbeitsplatz für mich, auch wenn ich ohne größere Blessuren davon kam.

Wir hatten damals in den 80ern Angst, dass jemand auf den falschen Knopf drückt und unsere Zivilisation in einem atomaren Krieg ausgelöscht wird. 

Wir hatten sauren Regen, ein Ozonloch und die Idee für einen Apfelbaum zu pflanzen konnte als ultimativer Optimismus durchgehen... 

Dann kam die Wende in Osteuropa. Walking through the park... on Scorpions gab die Hoffnung perfekt wieder. Es lief im Radio, als ich in Gdansk ein Werk besichtigt habe, für dessen Fortbestand ich dann  als westeuropäische Marketingexpertin gearbeitet habe. Das Werk gibt es heute noch. 

Ich bin nach ein paar Jahren zurück, wollte Familie und Beruf unter einem Hut bringen, Jetzt 30 Jahre später bin ich tatsächlich immer noch glücklich verheiratet, der Sohn ist im Masterstudium und im Job bin ich Abteilungsleiterin. Ich hab ein Haus in guter Lage, mit PV und mein E-Auto fährt mit dem eigenen Strom vom Dach. 
Ja, ich bin wohl eine Gewinnerin. Aber leicht, war/ ist es nicht. Und die Anstrengungen haben Spuren hinterlassen. Vom früheren Idealismus ist wenig geblieben. Digitalisierung schien ein Schlüssel zu mehr Teilhabe, Sharing Ökonomie und Wissen für alle.  Heute steuern Tech- Milliardäre über Social Media ""die Massen"". Ironically dadurch, dass sie ihnen weismachen, dass dagegen sein Freiheit bedeutet... 
Also was tun? Selbst überleben, die eigenen Interessen absichern und sich nicht ganz aufgeben und wenn es derweil auch nur dafür teicht, den VOLT Newsletter zu abonnieren. ",I made it!

This is very present in public (at demonstrations, counter-demonstrations), publicly held debates,social media platforms, and also mainstream media, and even universities.  People holding different or more nuanced perspectives on such issues are increasingly vilified or attempted to be silenced, and increasingly overtly. Contentious issues are presented in increasingly binary ways ('for', 'against'; and adding defamatory labels on the 'other', aiming to delegitimize and increasingly dehumanise others holding different opinions or positions. 
Regardless of the specific issue where this manifests, this tendency is a very dangerous development for our democratic societies, leading to ever-increasing polarisation and radicalisation, and incitement to hate and violence, and terrorism, and a breakdown of democratic values and societies. 

In such a climate, it is becoming very difficult for individuals to voice different perspectives and different world-views in public (and often even within personal networks), whether off-line or online. In many contexts (workplace settings), discourse about such issues is therefore often avoided, to prevent the outbreak of conflicts. 

In my view, we urgently need spaces and processes that allow the expression of 'minority views' and dissenting voices, in line with democratic values (free speech, expression of values), whilst always staying respectful of other peoples' different views. In the spirit of this quote: 

""“I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”
― S.G. Tallentyre, The Friends of Voltaire""

or this: 
""“If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”
― George Orwell""

Das Gesprächsthema war klar. Wir mussten über das, was ein paar Stunden vorher passiert war, sprechen. Wir beide hatten mitbekommen, wie unsere liebe Kollegin aus der Ukraine mit Tränen am Schreibtisch saß. Wir haben ihr zugehört. Wir haben gehört, wie ihre nächste Familie den Krieg erlebt. Es sind Bilder, die, ohne dass wir sie selbst erlebt haben, sich in den Gedanken verkrallen. Der Tod eines ehemaligen Schulkameraden an der Front – er war sehr aufgeweckt, schlau und vielleicht erst fünfundzwanzig. Ich erinnere mich an die Postkarte meines Urgroßonkels. „Endlich geht’s los. Es geht Richtung Vaters Heimat“, steht handgeschrieben auf der Rückseite. Die Vorderseite zeigt ihn als Soldat. Drei Tage später wird er an der Front erschossen.

Aber meine Kollegin weint nicht mehr um ihren ehemaligen Schulkameraden. Auch nicht um ihren Vater und Bruder, die gegen Ende des Jahres eingezogen werden sollen. Sie weint, weil auch ihrem Mann und Vater ihres Sohnes die Ausweisung aus Deutschland droht und die Erneuerung des Ausweises nur noch in der Ukraine möglich ist. Wenn er zurück in die Ukraine geht, was passiert dann? Wenn es nach Merz und vielen anderen Politikern hier im Lande geht, dann sollten die Männer im Ausland ihr Vaterland verteidigen.

„Würdest du dein Vaterland verteidigen?“, frage ich meinen Kollegen. „Ja, es geht ja schließlich um die demokratischen Werte, um unsere Freiheit“, lautet seine Antwort. „Aber wenn du dafür dein Leben verlieren würdest, dein einziges Leben?“ – „Ja, weil ich dafür das Leben der anderen schützen kann“, lässt er mich wissen. Ich sage zu ihm: „Ich glaube, du bist zu weit weg vom Krieg, und es scheint für dich wie ein Spiel.“ Er ist empört und lässt mich wissen, dass der Krieg doch in Europa sei und gar nicht weit weg – es hätte so oder so ähnlich auch ein Politiker oder ein Journalist sagen können.

Ich sage zu ihm, nicht weil ich es weiß, sondern weil ich es vermute: „Wenn du jemanden sterben siehst und es um dich herum schrecklich ist, dann fragst du dich vielleicht, warum es sein muss, dass du für diesen Krieg dein Leben opferst. Für wen opferst du dich eigentlich wirklich?“ Ich schüttle den Kopf und sage zum Abschluss: „Kennst du Albert Schweitzer und sein Werk Die Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben?“ Er verneint, und ich beginne zu verstehen, dass er wohl wie mein Urgroßonkel eine Spielfigur sein kann und alles befeuert.

I don´t go to the doctor often, but when I do I would like to be listened to. Instead I will get advice along the standard lines of eat more healthy, get more sleep and exercise.  I feel that I have to overcome a lot of bias and prejudice to be taken seriously when I ask for help, also by women doctors by the way.

I find more attention in the media these days for the fact that medical sciences are based on a standard white male population and much more attention is needed for medical complaints of other groups, who may show very different symptoms and very different reactions to medications as well. In my experience this change of outlook and perspective is very necessary.

In may other domains I find similar bias against point of views other than standard white male.

Der Nachbar meines Bruders hat einen türkischen Hintergrund, eine Frau geheiratet &amp; ihren Nachnamen angenommen.
Als er mir seine Kontaktdaten zukommen ließ ""Dennis *Nachname*"" &amp; seine Frau schaut drüber, mit dem Kommentar 'schön deutsch geschrieben'.
Meine Reaktion *verwirrtfragendesgesicht*. Antwort Deniz (Nachname türkischer Herkunft übersetzt: Ziegenhüter).

Die eine, mir wichtige Frage die sich daraus ergibt:

Wieso ist im Türkischen der MÄNNLICHE Vorname ""Deniz"", im Deutschen ein geschlechtsneutraler Vorname &amp; seine 'deutsche' Variante ""Dennis"" männlich?!
Soll ich meinen geschätzten Freund nun informieren &amp; Ihm sagen dass er sich offiziell beim Standesamt umbenennen sollt, da man ihn sonst noch für einen neutralgeschlechtlichen Menschen hält. Das wäre ja grauenhaft.

Spaß bei Seite.

Das Selbstbestimmungsgesetzt, wie es in Deutschland ist, ist fortschrittlicher seit jeher. Ich bin so dermaßen froh darüber, dass ich ENDLICH meine Geschlechtsidentifikation *selbstbestimmt* (noch unter Auflagen) rechtswirksam beschließen darf. Dafür danke ich der Ampel! (bzw. Grün &amp; SPD).

Persönlicher Erfolg: Ab dem 24.04.2025 ist meine Geschlechtsidentität rechtsgültig &amp; meine Namensänderung ist besiegelt. beinahe eine Art Geburtstagserfolg, vier Tage vor dem selbigen Meinen.

Diesen Erfolg, bzw. die Motivation, die daraus entsteht, um in Zukunft andere zu unterstützen diesen Weg zur Freiheit der Selbstbestimmung des eigenen Vornamens &amp;, oder des selbstidentifizierten Geschlechts zu bestreiten UND den Pfad in der zukunft zu befestigen, um eine Bundesweit &amp; im Folgenden Europaweite Roadmap einzugliedern.",Deniz?

Mijn bevinding: Een bijzonder naargeestig boek. Het stenigen van overspeligen, afhakken van handen van diegenen die stelen (zonder nuance op leeftijd of situatie), het doden van ongelovigen of afvalligen; het staat er allemaal in! De meeste moslims zullen dit boek niet gelezen hebben en gewoon goede bedoelingen hebben maar teveel blijken deze geboden ter harte te nemen. De vele publieke uitingen van moslimaanhang en soms zelfs de roep tot invoering van de sharia ervaar ik, atheïst, als bedreigend. 
Vijf fundamentele verplichtingen heeft een islamiet (de vijf 'zuilen'): 1) Geloofsbelijdenis, 2) rituele gebeden, 3) pelgrimstocht naar Mekka, 4) vasten tijdens ramadan en 5) het geven van aalmoezen. Wat een ijdele God! Alleen de laatste zuil lijkt een maatschappelijk nuttige.

Even if critical cases can be identified and can be treated properly, lots of others won't be so lucky. Although a lot can be done to postpone these developments, they will be very hard to avoid. Thus, hard choices will have to be made, differing from country to country, from region to region, depending on population characteristics, (regional) resources and preferences. Who will be treated and who will have to take care of themselves (pay they own treatments privately, not being treated at all, having to ask their children or families to help them, etc. It is crucial that citizens can and will take responsibility for the hard choices which will have to be made, most of which will become effective at the regional level.

Van die 40 jaar heb ik er 37 met veel plezier met mijn honden gewandeld en ze op plekken waar dat veilig kan los laten lopen - per slot van rekening hebben windhonden een grote bewegingsdrang en een navenante actieradius. Min of meer gelijktijdig met de enorme hondenaanschafwoede ten tijde van Corona, zijn het plezier en de ontspanning die ik beleefde aan het wandelen met mijn honden enorm vergald. Tegenwoordig word ik twee van de drie keer uitgescholden voor alles wat mooi en vooral lelijk is. Anderen willen niet dat mijn windhonden -de vriendelijkheid zelve- zelfstandig op een losloopterrein wat rondrennen. Ze moeten onder appèl, onder controle, dicht bij me blijven, gehoorzamen. Daar is een oosterse windhond niet voor in de wieg gelegd.

Vorige week was ik bijvoorbeeld een k*twijf met k*thonden. Bovendien heeft de producent van deze taaluiting mijn kenteken opgeschreven en de politie gealarmeerd. Iedere poging iets over het karakter of gedrag van windhonden is aan dovemansoren gezegd. Deze onheuse bejegening grijpt mij aan. Ik voel mij niet meer vrij, ik loop voortdurend alert rond te kijken of ik iemand zie die iets zou kunnen vinden.  Ik ken deze mensen niet, zij kennen mij niet, zij kennen mijn honden niet.

In den meisten Fällen wird das Syndrom erst bei der Geburt erkannt. Wir hatten das Glück, dass meine Frau zwei Monate vor der Entbindung die Frauenärztin gewechselt hat, welche das Syndrom sofort erkannte. Die Ärzte in der Uni-Klinik, in welcher meine Frau entbunden hat, hatte keine Zeit sich mit unserer Situation vorab intensiver auseinander zu setzen, weswegen vorab noch von einer spontanen Geburt gesprochen wurde und sich erst einen Tag vor dem Entbindungstermin von seitens der Ärzte für einen Kaiserschnitt entschieden wurde. Nach der Geburt wurden von der Uniklinik mehrere Tests gemacht, welche zum großteil Fehldiagnosen beinhalteten (taub, grauer starr, sehr frühe Operationen zum trennen von Knochen...). Wir hatten vorab Kontakt zur Elterninitiative für apert Kinder, wodurch wir erfahren hatten, dass wir für die Untersuchungen in Fachkliniken gehen müssen.
13 Tage nach der Geburt haben wir unsere Tochter gegen ärztlichen Rat aus der Uniklinik entlassen (es wurde viel Druck gemacht, dass wir dies nicht tun sollten) und sind von Schleswig-Holstein nach Würzburg zur Fachklinik gefahren. Hier wurden alle Untersuchungen erneut durchgeführt und wir könnten nach drei Tagen wieder nach Hause und hatten einen Fahrplan, welche Behandlugen und Operationen unsere Tochter wann benötigt und in welche Kliniken wir fahren müssen.
Die Eltern aus der Elterninitiative bestätigten uns, dass bei fast allen die Geburtskliniken probieren die weitere Behandlung bei sich durch zu führen und nicht auf eine der Fachkliniken zu verweisen.

After what happend of the 7th of October 2023 in Israel, there was no way you can say anything other than ""Hamas is a terror group and Israel is a victim"", and absolutely no word other than that. Actually, you were asked to say this, and if you you don't, than you're an Antisemit and terrorists' supporter blinded by hate and religion. Now, I personally am an Atheist, and I consider Religion a main cause of many of the problems in the world. I live in Germany since 10 years, I am a german citizen now and I come originally from Syria, and I know how militias like Hamas and Hizbullah are not only terrorists for their actions against Israel, but also against their own people. And I know how these militias were and are being used by dictator like Assad-regime in Syria and Iran's regime to keep themselves in power. Yet I know, how such militias came to be and that there's history before the 7th. of October and that most of the people in the region have the same view, but are so smashed by Israel and dictatorships and the world, so that they can't do anything. Now, this is a short description and there's a lot more to say about that.
With that being cleared (I hope), my experience was that I got really scared of even talking about the matter. I always had to declare my hate to Hamas, my acknowledgement that it's a terror group and performed a terror attack, and it wasn't accepted to discuss anything more, not to mention civilians, history, how -in my knowledge as a person coming from there and knows the people and history better- did it get to this point, how people there think and what they wish, and so on.. This was and still is so terrifying.","unacceptance of others, restriction of freedom of speech",,1,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,Very negative,0.21,,,,0.76,,,,0.89,,,,0.09,,,,0.578125,0.38944469424460426,0.3894446942446043,0.2271526528776978,0.38340265287769787,,0.509375,0.38944469424460426,0.3894446942446043,0.2959026528776978,0.3146526528776979,,0.26875,0.42181879496402874,0.4218187949640287,0.5203406025179856,0.05784060251798562,,0.390625,0.19879721223021585,0.19879721223021585,0.5099763938848921,0.2912263938848921,,0.9158220806637326,0.4028461716534184,0.9355292191376557,0.8940636896343263,,"a big capable HULK (strength and morl wise), but who sees himself and acts as a dwarf who always has to follow others and their orders","a sphynix, who went through dramatic history, learned a lot, have the potential to be Plato's Republic and the world's leader of innovation and science, but it's not!?",a human right,everyone,"in the 21 Century, and after all we know and can, why isn't science, in all its aspects (Physics, Psychology, Neurobiology, Cosmology, Philosophy, ...), the basic and solid ground for everything in your politics as well as in the society?",very common,Germany,,Male,34 - 54,,I consent to the processing of my data under the privacy policy of Volt Europa A.I.S.B.L. ,398,,,,1731180537527,Chrome,1731191383952,WebCollector 2.4,130,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,voltnws,,,3f7618f28606484fb71f78db5c24c850,email-we-want-to-revolutionize-democracy-with-you-share-your-story,1,we-want-to-revolutionize-democracy-with-you-share-your-story,email_2510744,,,,,,,,,,

Wie kann das sein?! Danach keimte deutlich in mir auf, etwas zur Verständigung zu tun, dass die Menschen wieder miteinander reden statt sich Polarisierungen und Projektionen auszusetzen. Gemeinsam haben wir ein Format entwickelt, Demokratie im Kleinen erlebbar zu machen durch Dialog, Zuhören, Begegnung, einen ""Sicheren"" Raum, zur Essenz und den Menschen hinter der Meinung zu finden. 
Inzwischen haben wir ein paar solcher Veranstaltungen durchgeführt. Jedes Mal kamen andere Menschen, einige kamen öfters, nicht nur aus der ""Aktivisten/Wandel-Blase"". Und jedes Mal gingen sie mit mehr Lebendigkeit, einem Lächeln und im regen Gespräch mit Neu-Kennengelernten wieder nach Hause. Einige haben sich persönlich bei uns bedankt und gebeten, ob sowas nicht öfters stattfinden kann. 
Ja, das kann es und so macht Demokratie Spaß! Doch braucht es dafür viel mehr Mittel (wir hatten das Glück, durch eine kleine Kooperation Fördermittel zu bekommen, um unseren Aufwand wenigstens ehwas bezahlt zu bekommen). Und es braucht Befähigung/Trainings, um viel mehr Menschen zu befähigen, Dialog- u.ä. Formate zu moderieren/hosten.
Vergangene Woche haben wir die US-Wahlen und den Bruch unserer Ampelregierung erlebt. Wieder regt das in mir an, wie wichtig solche Räume sind zur Stärkung der Demokratie. Das macht Sinn, braucht viel Energie (Bürger*innen sind anstrengend ;) weil inhomogen etc.) und ist ungaublich sinnvoll und wichtig.

In meinen wenigen Jahren habe ich aber viele Politische und Gesellschaftliche Veränderungen mitbekommen. Ich sah zu wie Merkel ihre letzte Kanzler Kandidatschaft ankündigte, ich sah zu wie Donald Trump zwei mal gewählt wurde, wie Russische Soldaten ein unabhängiges Land angriffen haben und ich hab den rechtsrück begutachten müssen. Die Zeit in der wir Leben ist schwer, aber ich bleibe trotz allem im Sturm der Zeit optimistisch wenn ich Parteien oder Projekte wie Volt sehe. Ein Zentralisiertes Europa hätte die Möglichkeit sich als ein wahrer Mitstreiter auf der Internationalen Bühne sich als vereinte und kräftige Macht sich positionieren. Durch Zentralisierung können wir unsere Infrastruktur verbessern, das Klima effizienter schützen, die Lebensbedingung aller Menschen in Europa und sogar auf der Welt zu verbessern, Demokratie zu fordern und zu Stabilisieren und die Wirtschaft effizienter und besser zu machen. Viele sagen das Europa Projekt ist gescheitert oder führt zu nichts oder zu unseren Abgrund. Da Frage ich mich nur wieso diese Menschen nicht an etwas glauben können was sich schon mehr als bewiesen hat.

Hij was een succesvol landbouw engineer die ook nog eens een zeer succesvolle kwekerij had.

Die UN-BRK wurde ratifiziert, aber alles, was verändert werden muss, wird von vielen Menschen in unserer Gesellschaft als Zumutung empfunden. Diese innere Haltung, die keiner – außer der AfD - laut artikuliert– führt dazu, dass nur so getan wird, als ob man etwas für marginalisierte Gruppen tut. In Wahrheit ändert sich nichts. Dieser weit verbreitete Tokenismus ist eine Schande, weil so unheimlich viel Geld verschwendet wird, ohne dass etwas dabei herumkommt. 

Dabei gibt es noch immer viel zu viele Verstöße gegen die Menschenrechte und die körperliche Unversehrtheit in marginalisierten Communitys. 

Es ist schlicht unglaublich, was beispielsweise derzeit taub geborenen Kindern in den westlichen reichen Ländern angetan wird. In der Medizin hat man das Cochlea-Implantat erfunden und nun wird es jedem Baby, das kurz nach der Geburt als hochgradig schwerhörig oder taub diagnostiziert wird, in einer großen, teuren OP eingepflanzt. Da geht es um viel Geld, und die Kliniken verdienen gut daran. Es ist völlig unklar, ob diese Kinder überhaupt davon profitieren. Und was noch viel schlimmer ist: Eltern haben auf Druck der Ärzte aufgehört, mit ihren Kindern gebärdensprachlich zu kommunizieren. Das führt aktuell zu einer sogenannten sprachlich induzierten geistigen Behinderung bei den Kindern, weil sie zu wenig sprachlichen Input bekommen und ihr sprachliches, kognitives System sich nicht entfalten kann. Wenn das Kind sich dann nicht so entwickelt, wie gewünscht, womit die erste übrigens dann nichts mehr zu tun haben und dafür auch keine Verantwortung übernehmen, werden irgendwelche nicht validen Diagnostik-Instrumente herangezogen und die Kinder, die eigentlich nur taub sind, und sich mit Gebärdensprache kognitiv ganz normal entwickeln würden, bekommen dann die Diagnose ""geistig behindert"". So landen die Kinder in Förderschulen für Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten, wo sie gar keinen gebärdensprachlichen Input mehr bekommen und der Input mit dem CI auf lautsprachlicher Ebene defizitär ist. Das bedeutet, dass gesunde normale Kinder, die mit einer Gebärdensprache eine normale kognitive Entwicklung genommen hätten, durch diese Praxis einen kognitiven neurologischen Schaden erleiden, der niemals wieder gutzumachen ist. Sie landen später in Heimen oder in der Psychiatrie.
Es ist nicht nur empörend, sondern einfach skandalös, dass es aktuell zu einer Epidemie der Sprachdeprivation kommt. Darauf weist die ""World Federation of the Deaf"" ( https://signhealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022-Position-paper-on-access-to-national-sign-languages-as-a-health-need-World-Federation-of-the-Deaf.pdf )und die 'National Association of the Deaf' ( https://www.nad.org/language-deprivation/ )schon lange hin.

Many tried to undermine or revise our revolution. But the further we go, the more apparent does the need for unity is. As America has a high chance of abandoning our continent, we must come together as brothers to defend ourselves and prosper jointly. This war will define Europe's future, and in one scenario Europe stands tall, it stands united under the Golden Stars on a Blue Banner, russia stands defeated and decolonised, if stands at all. In the other, Europe will be turned into collection of bickering nation-states fighting over old grudges, committing further atroctities, just as we did before European Unity was realised. In that scenario, the fascist russia stands hegemonical over Europe, and freedom is nigh extinguished in the world. Thankfully, i can see clearly that Europeans choose the first path.

I know the language, culture, and have a Dutch passport.  There are no barriers to working at my career level. And yet, I have been unemployed over a year, have experienced a great deal of sexism from male hiring managers and male CEO's as interviewers. I note, no women in the process other than the secretary, and I hear statements of bias that are cringeworthy. And I hear those statements alone, which adds to my streee.   When Dutch companies want a seasoned expert on their board or running their department, they find they have confidence in a man, regardless of skills, experience, or seniority, and declare that they hire the ""best &amp; brightest regardless of gender"". There may be a smaller pay gap than in my mother's generation, however, there is less career mobility: women are 8% of C-level in the EU, less in IT, even if we comprise 47% of the entry level. Experts tell me to go to LinkedIn (everybody did already), and yet, in my experience as a woman, ""equal rights"" does not translate to my experience in the Dutch labour market.

De America first politiek, uitingen van haat, het kleineren van bevolkingsgroepen, het liegen over anderen en het zwart maken van media stemmen somber. Bij de eerste verkiezing van Trump was de schok groot, zijn winst is dit keer vele mate groter maar de schokt lijkt kleiner. Er is sprake van gewenning. In Nederland en in Europa gaan we nog meer last krijgen van Trump en de stellingname van de VS op het wereld toneel. Dit staat echter niet op zichzelf. Treurig vind ik de parallellen die inmiddels met de NL politiek zijn te trekken. Mocht het kabinet vanavond vallen dan zal de winst van (extreem) rechts alleen maar groter worden. Ondertussen weten de midden partijen en linkse partijen onvoldoende concreet te maken wat ze voor de gewone man en vrouw op de straat gaan betekenen. Het gaat vooral over het hoe (met of zonder Europa etc), niet over het Why en What. De grote thema’s, de visie, het resultaat blijft toch wel grotendeels uit.

Dieser Verdacht wurde von einer Beratungsstelle für Autismus bestätigt. Die offizielle Diagnose muss aber durch eine*n Psychiater*in erfolgen. Das Problem: Niemand aus dem Fachbereich Psychiatrie, der für mich erreichbar ist, kann mich behandeln/diagnostizieren, weil sich niemand damit auskennt. Die Fachärzt*innen und Therapeut*innen sind überlastet, weil von den Krankenkassen keine neuen Praxisgenehmigungen ausgestellt werden, sprich es gibt zu wenige Behandler*innen. Entsprechend kommen viele Patient*innen auf die wenigen vorhandenen Praxen. So bleibt keine Zeit für Behandler*innen, um sich in neue, weniger bekannte Gesundheitsthemen (z. B. Autismus) einzuarbeiten.

Ich bin im Alltag stark eingeschränkt, kann kaum einkaufen gehen, keinen Job langfristig halten, kann nicht studieren, obwohl ich intellektuell überdurchschnittlich bin. Es gibt staatlich geförderte Unterstützungsangebote für Autist*innen. Die bekommt man aber nur mit einer entsprechenden Diagnose.
Psychiater*innen und Psychotherapeut*innen lehnen die Behandlung ab, sobald sie das Wort ""Autismus"" hören.

Die wenigen Spezialist*innen im Bereich Autismus haben eine Wartezeit von bis zu 2 Jahren und sind für mich sehr schlecht erreichbar. Ich brauche eine Begleitperson, um die Termine wahrzunehmen. In meinem Umfeld gibt es aufgrund von Arbeitstätigkeit und Pflegefällen in der Familie niemanden, der mich begleiten könnte. Eine staatlich geförderte Begleitung bekomme ich auch wieder nur mit gestellter Diagnose.

Ich lebe mittlerweile laut deutscher Statistik in Armut. Ich weiß, dass ich prinzipiell in der Lage bin, ein halbwegs selbstständiges Leben zu führen, benötige aber für einige Zeit Unterstützung und Alltagsbegleitung, um diese Selbstständigkeit zu erlangen. Schon allein ein Schwerbehindertenausweis würde mir helfen. Aber auch hierfür muss ich die entsprechenden Diagnosen und Gutachten vorweisen.

Fazit:
Es müssen mehr Gelder für psychiatrische/psychologische Behandlungsangebote freigemacht werden. Außerdem muss die Begrenzung der Anzahl an psychiatrischen/psychotherapeutischen Praxen durch die staatlichen Krankenkassen aufgehoben werden. Medizinische Versorgung darf nicht eingeschränkt werden! Das sollte wichtiger sein, als die Auto- und Kohleindustrie.",Autismus in unserem derzeitigen Gesundheitssystem,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,Very negative,0.999999,,,,0.999999,,,,0.999999,,,,0.999999,,,,0.6140350877192983,0.43041063835999505,0.43041063835999505,0.17075959310070432,0.39882976853930074,,0.8201754385964912,0.2385560429619914,0.2385560429619914,0.060546539922513014,0.7008974171154957,,0.3114035087719298,0.4708010794964168,0.4708010794964168,0.4531959514798618,0.07600296902372139,,0.6491228070175439,0.00000999999999995449,0.00000999999999995449,0.3508721929824562,0.6491178070175438,,0.8550073054798862,0.524624047593229,0.2326388777348033,0.843677311594207,,meine Nationalität.,mein Zuhause.,ein Segen für die Mehrheit.,Politiker*innen im Gesundheitsministerium und Finanzministerium.

Ich war enttäuscht und empört, dass meine Partei in dieser plakativen Form Feindbilder schafft. Nach einigem Zögern beschloss ich mich dazu auch öffentlich zu äußern, weil ich in Gesprächen mit Menschen der älteren Generation über 50 eine ähnliche Ablehnung dieser Art der Kommunikation erfahren hatte. Mein Aufruf, dieses Poster das im Keller zu lassen löste eine lebendige Debatte aus. Und ich spürte dass hier ein deutlicher Unterschied zwischen der jüngeren und älteren Generation besteht.

De dichtstbijzijnde super is op 8 km - en met de bus kan alleen aan begin en eind van de dag (er is alleen in de schoolperiode een scholierenbus of je moet 2 uur tevoren een haltebus bestellen). de straten zijn ook veel leger; het was altijd een af en aan rijden van NL en B klanten.

De bureaucratie waarmee ze geconfronteerd werd was afgrijselijk. Voor haar was het ondoenlijk om via een webportaal de inschrijving tot een goed einde te brengen. Twee uur zijn we samen bezig geweest en nog was ze niet ingeschreven. Eerst moest ze een account aanmaken bij de verhuurmakelaar. Ze moest haar hele persoonlijke en financiële leven bloot geven.

Each time I first explain that I am resident in Germany before then demonstrating that the gate does work for me. Mildy annoying but better than the long queue for a person.
When I moved back to Germany after living in Switzerland, I simply drove over the border without getting an entry stamp. When I travelled whilst waiting for my residence permit to be processed, the German border guard was very confused how a British citizen managed to have a German exit stamp but no entry stamp. After a long discussion and pointing out that my temporary visa was issued from the German embassy in Bern, I was finally let through. Such things happen post-Brexit.

Beispielsweise höre ich von immer mehr Jugendlichen, dass sie es leid sind, süchtig nach Bildschirmzeit zu sein. Sie wissen, dass sie süchtig sind, aber kommen nicht weg davon. Gleichzeitig ist das Bildungssystem er Meinung, die Schule muss immer digitaler werden. Für jedes Fach gibt es einen Online-Klassenraum, wo Aufgaben gestellt und abgegeben werden müssen etc. Online-Nachhilfe wird von Nachhilfeinstituten forciert. Das einzige, was die Jugendlichen nicht mitkriegen, ist eine fundierte digitale Bildung. Sie wollen nicht so viel am Bildschirm kleben, werden aber dazu gezwungen. Wer hätte sich das vor 30 Jahren  gedacht, als es hieß, die Jugendlichen gehen nicht mehr raus und sie bekämen ""viereckige Augen"" vom Fernsehen? 
Das ist nur eines von hunderten Beispielen. Egal ob es um Bildungspolitik, mentale Gesundheit, oder was auch immer geht: Die Anliegen der Jugendlichen werden von Erwachsenen – der Politik wie aller anderen – als minderwertig abgetan oder gar nicht erst gehört. Was sollen Jugendliche schon wissen? Sie werden von Erwachsenen in ein System gepresst, das sie unterdrückt.

The ease of travel, crossing the border with no problems, train infrastructure and the fact there was a high speed connection at all surprised her and made her love Europe. She now absolutely wants to live in Europe with me, something she wasn't entirely sure of before visiting.

I was brought in as a service provider to  play a very small role in using complexity thinking to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The people who commissioned my services were Americans. On the call were Americas, Brits, Israelis and Palestinians. A Palestinian woman who was part of the process became enraged at the service we were providing yet was gracious enough to apologise to me afterwards. I felt sick thinking about how much space she holds for others even as a bulls-eye is painted on her back. I am a British woman of Irish descent. My great-grandmother had to hide in her back-garden from murderous British soldiers. My grandma who moved to England faced a lifetime of brutal prejudice. She had to live with the paradoxical decision of fleeing to the UK to escape the British occupation of Ireland. Her children and grandchildren are of course Brits. She tried to distance us from our Irish roots to gain us freedom.  For example she pretended she could not speak the Irish language even though she had to learn English as a second language as a child. This felt like a betrayal at first. I would ask her about a Gaelic word that she had carved on the house. She would say ""I don't know."" I later found out, after she had passed, that that word translated meant ""freedom"" in Gaelic. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't tell me. I'm technically still an EU citizen by virtue of my Irish roots though I haven't applied for the Irish passport to which I'm entitled yet. I'm somehow more acutely aware of my difference from other Brits and the prejudice I face post-Brexit. I remember The Guardian (supposedly a progressive newspaper) publishing a column commenting on every 'Tom, Mick and Paddy' applying for an Irish passport post-Brexit. This is a play on the British expression ""Tom, Dick and Harry"" meaning everyone (Thomas, Richard, Harry are very common English names) and the racial slur against the Irish (""Micks and Paddys"" being a common slur.) Of course though that racism has always been there. I find the pro-european sentiment in my country uncomfortable post-Brexit. Are you asking me to identify with immigrants (I do)? Are you asking me to identify with people because they are white (I don't)? I guess Im sharing all this to say that even in our small corner of Europe things are so complicated and so small and volatile. Don't forget us because en masse we voted to Leave. Don't forget the value of seeing our shared humanity. It's not about us being Europeans. It's about us being human beings.

Last September, SMER won the election here in Slovakia, and I just can't shake this feeling of dread. There are rumours that Fico wants to copy how elections are done in Belarus, and it's terrifying. This isn't how democracy is supposed to work. The idea of us sliding into that kind of authoritarianism makes my stomach churn.
And now, on top of that, Trump has won the elections in the US. It feels like the world is shifting in a way that's so dangerous for democratic values. Leaders who seem to thrive on division and control are gaining power, and it's like we're watching these foundational principles erode in real-time.

One motivation for that is that I don't want to engage at the level of exchanging opinions, most of all, when the views expressed are superficial and somewhat triggered. It's like this is lost energy. A second motivation for not engaging is the apparent lack of a debating culture in our society. People are no longer (have they ever?) willing to engage in real debate and really listen to other people's viewpoints that are unlike their own - with an openness to explore and some curiosity.  The Corona times in Germany was a terrible period, people could not state their viewpoints and positions without being marginalised, categorised, or stigmatized - sometimes with incredible social, financial and health consequences. I guess that shock is still in my system.  A third motivation for not engaging: generally, people are not really well informed about what is going on. Too much information, misinformation or biased information around.

In meiner Stadt in der ich wohne sitzen oft Menschen auf der Straße, die um Geld betteln. Früher habe ich ab und zu etwas Kleingeld gegeben.

Seiner Ansicht nach war sie also keine Obdachlose, sondern Teil einer organisierten Gruppe, die sich als Bettler ausgeben. Seitdem ich diese Ansicht von meinem Mitbewohner gehört habe, bin ich viel skeptischer geworden und gebe kein Geld mehr zu bettelnden Personen.

Opisovať všetky jednotlivé problémy by bolo veľmi na dlho, ale v skratke - školu v podstate skončí každý kto chce (nedostatočné nároky vedúce k znižovaniu cennosti diplomu/titulu - spôsobené nedostatkom žiakov na škole - spôsobené zlou reputáciou školy - kvalitní študenti odchádzajú do Česka alebo inde a škola sa z ľudí ktorí sa prihlásia na školu (čo sú aj kvalitní ale aj nekvalitní študenti) sa škola snaží vyprodukovať stále rovnaké množstvo študentov.) 
Školu viem porovnať aj na základe skúseností z môjho študijného pobytu na Politecnico di Torino. Na základe toho si myslím, že škola nespolupracuje ani na úrovni fakulty dostatočne (žabomyšie vojny medzi ústavmi - kto je väčší pán) a neexistuje spoločná snaha o výskum, posun školy.
Rád by som pokračoval v štúdiu na PhD úrovni, no toto u nás nemá absolútne zmysel (čo nie je len môj názor, ale aj názor kolegov s ktorými teraz pracujem a odišli zo školy či už pred, v priebehu alebo po ukončení PhD z rovnakých dôvodov) a ak chcem pracovať v odbore na state of the art výskume, sa hlásiť na školy v zahraničí  čo je veľmi náročné.
Treba povedať aj to, že na škole sú aj veľmi kvalitní ľudia ktorí ma veľa naučili, ale bohužiaľ nezamestnateľní ľudia čo sedia na svojej ""teplej"" pozícii blokujú ich rozvoj rovnako ako nedostatok peňazí na kúpu vybavenia ale takisto na dôstojné platy pre týchto ľudí.",Vysoké školstvo,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Negative,0.999999,,,,,,,1,0.18,,,,0.999999,,,,0.4963280200717509,0.38652714474545036,0.38652714474545036,0.3104084075555239,0.30306444769902574,,0.4973990955385552,0.9277270110386175,0.9277270110386175,0.038737398942136014,0.03353559001924644,,0.181915547646012,0.29078698377935586,0.29078698377935586,0.67269096046431,0.036522055756334076,,0.7895884726106374,0.00000999999999995449,0.00000999999999995449,0.21040652738936275,0.7895834726106375,,0.1938398779670419,0.16338118483295305,0.9159939702570344,0.8159867774164546,,Domov,Domov,Správna cesta,"Vysoká škola (už počula)

The cause of the war was based on the fact that  Cyprus's government since its establishment in 1960, was unable to safeguard  the constitution of the Republic of Cyprus. (The constitution is based on a partnership between the two bigger ethnic communities of Cyprus, in which the GC was the 80% and the TC 20% of the population)Due to this anomaly, injustice the island was invaded by Turkey and is divided into the north and south part. 
Now in our part there is the feeling that injustice in all the civil aspects is prevailing.

Vorige week heeft de politie na vele meldingen van overlast ingegrepen door een aantal van deze jongeren 'uit de anonimiteit' te halen en hun namen te noteren. Dat ging niet zonder slag of stoot. Tijdens het politieoptreden kwam een vader van een van de jongeren naar de plaats-delict om verhaal te halen en zijn zoon te bevrijden uit de greep van de politie. Dat deed hij op een dusdanig agressieve manier dat politieagenten hem tegen de grond werkten en meenamen naar het politiebureau. Ook zijn twee jongeren meegenomen. De vader heeft zijn excuses aangeboden en werd direct vrij gelaten. De twee jongeren hebben een nacht in de cel gezeten. De volgende dag is op de nationale tv aandacht gegeven aan dit incident door Elly Lust, een landelijk bekende oud-agente. Zij hekelde vooral ook het gedrag van de vader van de raddraaier en spoorde haar kijkerspubliek aan dergelijk gedrag te helpen stoppen.  Ik was aangenaam verrast door het kordate optreden van de politie en de positieve media-aandacht voor dit incident.

With me travelling away a lot, he suddenly experienced himself as being utterly cut off, and powerless to make choices for simple things like shopping.  Attempts to use public transport led to frustration and increased powerlessness, as there is no local train station and the buses are utterly unreliable, often not turning up at all, let alone on time.

He found himself having to ask neighbours for lifts (which he hated doing), and I experienced myself becoming more and more unwilling to accept work that kept me away from home for more than a day or two at best.  We felt our world closing in on us.

Ultimately, even though he got his licence back when the health issue was resolved, we decided to leave the village, and have now moved to central London - the opposite to what many people do at our age.  We have been surprised to find that local engagement and invitation to get to know others is BETTER here than it was in our Devon village, which we now realise was cliquey and hard to enter if you weren't born there, and didn't have school aged kids, or belong to a religious community.

What started as a transport problem, was actually more to do with becoming vulnerable in a community that we found it hard to engage with, and made little effort to engage us.

Nachdem sich meine Frau getrennt hat beansprucht sie die alleinige Deutungshoheit des Kindeswohls und auch beim Jugendamt wird intuitiv davon ausgegangen, dass eine Mutter grundsätzlich fähiger ist Kinder zu erziehen. Das merke ich vor allem an der Fehlerkultur. Ich bin nicht perfekt, muss meine Abweichungen der Norm (bei der auch fraglich ist, wer die eigentlich festlegt) viel stärker rechtfertigen, als meine Expartnerin. Vor allem die Differenzierung zwischen Paar- und Elternebene ist sehr schwierig, da ich den Eindruck habe, dass kritische Meinungen auf Elternebene ausgeblendet werden mit dem Argument, dass sich dieses Thema auf einer Paarebene befindet und damit nicht mehr diskutiert werden muss. Will ich meine Standpunkte vor den Kinder vertreten, werde ich mit dem Argument eines drohenden Loyalitätskonfliktes bei den Kindern zur Konformität gezwungen. Das ist meines Erachtens nach nicht mit einer Meinungs- und Informationsfreiheit vereinbar, da sich die Kinder und ich nicht frei austauschen können. Auch die Tatsache, dass meine Expartnerin de facto alleinerziehend ist und meine Erziehung aktiv einschränkt ist für mich nicht mit demokratischen Grundsätzen vereinbar. Wenn Erwachsene alleine mit Kindern sind, haben sie eine Machtposition, die keine angemessene Opposition erfährt. In unserem Fall werde ich mit meiner in Teilen abweichenden Meinung aus dem Familienalltag, der Kommunikation und der Entscheidungsfindung ausgeschlossen. Legislative, Exekutive und Judikative sind in einer Person vereint. Daher gleicht meine Familie aktuell leider mehr einer totalitären Diktatur als einer pluralistischen Demokratie. Besonders brisant ist diese Entwicklung, da die Familie für Kinder das primäre Sozialisationsumfeld darstellt. Als Gesellschaft sollten wir also darauf achten gerade in Familienstrukturen demokratische Haltungen und Werte zu fördern, damit diese wenn die Kinder Erwachsen sind gut trainiert und resilient gegen antidemokratische Kräfte sind. Auch das Thema Sexismus gegenüber Männern ist in der Gesellschaft noch zu wenig präsent, sodass Männer und Frauen blind in Situationen geraten, welche die Spirale der Gewalt zwischen den Geschlechtern weiter antreibt.",Demokratie in Familiensystemen,,1,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,Negative,0.83,,,,0.13,,,,0.999999,,,,0.77,,,,0.5,0.0405238309352518,0.0405238309352518,0.479738084532374,0.4797380845323741,,0.5,0.3570705935251799,0.3570705935251799,0.32146470323741005,0.32146470323741005,,0.35,0.5980777877697843,0.5980777877697843,0.350961106115108,0.050961106115107846,,0.509375,0.02973246402877694,0.02973246402877694,0.47575876798561145,0.49450876798561155,,0.2111486486486487,0.6962103259754072,0.06756756756756757,0.31884761069542666,,eine ineffektive gute Idee,die Vision einer geeinten Menschheit,eine wichtige Stufe der politischen Entwicklung,Alle Eltern.

Many lack authenticity and fail to address real issues in a meaningful way. On the rare occasions when they do, their proposals often seem poorly substantiated, inadequately thought through, and devoid of integrity or courage.

Values like courage, authenticity, and integrity feel like relics of a distant past. Where are the leaders of substance and vision? Too many politicians seem to hide behind platitudes, chase superficial victories, indulge in bluster, and prioritize short-term gains over long-term solutions.

Worse yet, many party leaders appear more focused on securing their own positions than on serving the greater good.

Ik ben samen met mijn vrouw al twee jaar deelnemer / 'klant' van dat autodelen. Dus via een app kan je auto reserveren, ontgrendelen gebruiken en afrekenen. Deze borrel was voor het eerst dat ik andere deelnemers trof en sprak. Ik vond het leuk om wat meer achtergrond te horen over hoe dit initiatief was ontstaan, wie er aan hadden bijgedragen etc. We raakten in gesprek over hoe ieder het gebruik van de deelauto's ervaarde. En over welke mogelijkheden we nog meer zagen. Zouden we subsidie van de gemeente kunnen vragen? Zouden we dit als cooperatie nog meer zelf kunnen doen (tarieven vaststellen etc)? Hoe mooi zou het zijn als er minder auto's geparkeerd in de straat staan? Hoe kunnen we dat vooral krijgen? Dat soort gesprekken had ik via de app nog nooit gehad. Kortom: door de kennismaking en verbinding ontstaat vrij natuurlijk gesprek en ideeën voor vervolg actie. Smaakt naar meer.

Die Titanplatten wurden mittlerweile aus ihrem Gesicht entfernt.
Sie kann ihren Job nicht mehr ausüben, eine Gesichtshälfte ist taub und sie ist auf dem Weg mittelstandslos zu werden.
Die Polizei hatte keinen Anreiz den Täter zu fassen. Der Täter ist aufgrund eigener Dummheit selber wegen eines anderen Themas zur Polizei gegangen und wurde dann festgenommen.
1 Jahr später durfte sie und eine andere Zeugin im Gerichtsaal dem aggressiven vorbestraften (versuchter Mord) Gewalttäter gegenübersitzen.
Der Täter wurde zu 1,5 Jahren und Psychatrie verurteilt. Dann darf er wahrscheinlich sogar (wieder) früher raus, weil er ""keine Gefahr mehr darstellt"".

In the morning there is a lot of traffic, so I have to squeeze past a lot of cars, which do not leave a lot of space for me. There was this big white van that was especially close to the side of the road, so the only way I could get past it was by getting on the sidewalk with my bike, moving forward 2-3 metres, and then getting back on the side of the road right in front of this van. I then continued cycling up to the traffic light, and once it turned green I continued my journey. Shortly after that the same white van made an especially close pass right in front of me, and that made me feel very uncomfortable and angry.

The key theme I raised was voting rights for migrants in CH, somebody from the group thought, it was a good idea to instruct me on how to enter a Swiss casino, that a EU passport would be enough for me. Nobody from the group intervened, so I stood alone in the WhatsApp group, without any bystanders to support my point.
When I found out, maybe a week and a couple of very unpleasant interactions with this person in the group later, that this situation would not improve, I left the Volt CH WhatsApp community and contacted my mentor at Volt CH. He agreed with my point of view and reported, he would address this problem (I was not the first one who had this kind of bully experience in the WhatsApp) with the Presidium.
We are now 2 weeks since then and no follow-up has been shared with me. I hope this will be done without any further delays. I feel very unwelcomed as an EU citizen in the political movement Volt that should foster European collaboration and civil rights.

De tijd dat complottheoriën en rechts-radikaal gedachtengoed een niche waren, iets ver weg van jou, iets van anderen, van vroeger, een klein groepje weirdo's waar je je over verbaasde, goed voor een documentaire op Netflix - die tijd is voorbij. Absurd genoeg is het krankzinnige gedachtegoed van deze mensen nu genormaliseerd. Ze zijn met velen. En heel dichtbij. In mijn geval zelfs binnen mijn gezin.

B. (funktionale) Analphabeten, Menschen mit Einschränkungen und auch mit Menschen deren Muttersprache nicht Deutsch ist. Daher verzichte ich ganz bewusst in Schrift und Sprache auf das korrekte Gendern und verwende einfache Sprache. Ich stelle mir dabei die Frage, was eigentlich inklusiv ist? Wenn Identität mehr ausgrenzt und spaltet als die Lebenswelt aller zu verbessern, sehe den Sinn nicht. 
Beispiel: Ich werde ich oft gefragt was ich wählen werde -  eigentlich Volt. Die Reaktionen sind fast immer gleich. Umwelt und Europa, ja. Aber zuviel Fokus auf Identität. Besonders wird das Thema LGBTQ+ wird in Angesicht unserer heutigen Probleme als zu groß empfunden. Nicht weil meine Gesprächspartner die Rechte queerer Menschen nicht respektieren, aber andere Themen werden eben als sehr viel wichtiger empfunden. Etwa 10 % der Wählerstimmen sind eine attraktive Aussicht, aber mindestens eben so viele werden Volt deswegen vielleicht nicht wählen. 
Wäre toll wenn Volt die LGBTQ+ Community auch mit den Themen erreichen könnte, von denen sich alle Bürger angesprochen fühlen. Die Menschen sind verunsichert. Meine Erfahrung ist ganz deutlich, die Menschen sehnen sich nach common Ground.

The maternity carer helping us the first days (which is a blessing), told me there's a kind of secret way of working for maternity carers all over The Netherlands with how they help undocumented or assylum seeking people with their new borns. There are a lot of rules and regulations prohibiting the maternity careres to help those in need, but they find ways to do so for example by not clocking the right amount of hours, or ficticiously assigning hours to people with better health insurance, to be able to help those that have no insurance. This story broke my heart and simultaneously warmed it. It's heartbreaking to hear that governments and insurance companies go out of their way to prevent people from getting care and it warms my heart to see people bending and breaking those rules to help those in need.

Non voglio però parlare della mia esperienza diretta (pur essendo anch'essa assai problematica) ma di quella dei molti studenti tirocinanti che ho avuto modo di incontrare.
Mi rendo conto  infatti sempre più spesso di quanto i miei colleghi studenti, con contratto da tirocinante curriculare (senza stipendio) siano sfruttati senza alcun ritegno.
Non è solo la mancata erogazione di un compenso a fronte di un impegno lavorativo full time in azienda (cosa di per sé inaccettabile), quanto piuttosto il sistema per cui si illudono queste persone facendo loro credere che riceveranno una formazione al lavoro adeguata e che questa esperienza aprirà loro le porte del mondo del lavoro, quando si tratta solamente di un modo per dare alle aziende qualcuno che lavori gratis...
Molto spesso si ricorre ai tirocini quando si ha bisogno di qualcuno che svolga qualche mansione faticosa o poco stimolante e non si ha voglia di pagare un dipendente. Tutto alla luce del sole, tutto esplicitamente detto: il tirocinante curriculare serve solo a fare il lavoro sporco senza sborsare soldi.
A volte il ""capo"" nemmeno si ricorda il nome dei tirocinanti, che vanno e vengono ad un ritmo vertiginoso e molto raramente hanno davvero dei rapporti formativi con i colleghi.
Il cinismo con il quale questo persone vengono trattate e' intollerabile, andrebbe ripensata alla radice la funzione dei tirocini, senza approfittare della debolezza di tutti quei giovani che sanno di essere vulnerabili nel mondo del lavoro contemporaneo e che devono sottostare a queste pratiche ingiuste ",Il gioco cinico dei tirocini ,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,Very negative,0.84,,,,0.33,,,,0.78,,,,0.79,,,,0.9610043061085236,0.00000999999999995449,0.00000999999999995449,0.03899069389147647,0.9609993061085236,,0.6415264423076923,0.38169908251426765,0.3816990825142676,0.16762401643517388,0.45067690105055846,,0.3002136426094251,0.15660725287513688,0.15660725287513688,0.6214827309530065,0.22191001617185668,,0.6199085529033954,0.1102398717177322,0.1102398717177322,0.3249715112377385,0.5647886170445293,,0.4639423443720891,0.5494778355405824,0.8255876761216384,0.42504280348291734,,Un ideale che può essere realizzato ma che richiede coraggio e impegno ,Una entità geopolitica che può dire la sua nei nuovi scenari futuri ,"Una forma di governo eccellente se i cittadini si impegnano a farla funzionare, pessima se scade nella demagogia e nel governo delle emozioni meschine e grette ","I politici, i partiti, i sindacati, il Parlamento Europeo ",Perché anziché incentivare un sistema di sfruttamento non si lavora davvero in un ottica professionalizzante e formativa?,very common,Italy,,Male,25 - 34,,I consent to the processing of my data under the privacy policy of Volt Europa A.I.S.B.L. ,443,,,,1738411454320,Chrome,1738413524042,WebCollector 2.4,131,it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,voltnws,,,c4cc1f955269a24ea05e0147a2a674e9,email-could-you-tell-us-one-thing,1,could-you-tell-us-one-thing,email_2603103,,,,,,,,,,

Das ist nur eine der vielen kleinen und großen Hürden die ihm auf Grund seines Status in den Weg gelegt werden. Er ist 1988 geboren und floh mit seinen Eltern und Geschwistern aus Georgien. Er ist in Deutschland zur Schule gegangen, hat hier seine Ausbildung gemacht und arbeitet seit dem ununterbrochen. Trotzdem bleibt ihm die deutsche Staatsangehörigkeit verwehrt. Seit Jahren zieht sich das juristische Verfahren. Er kann nicht heiraten oder Wahlen teilnehmen obwohl er hier lebt und Steuern zahlt.

Ik ben bijna 75 jaar en heb de internationale situatie niet zo bedreigend gevonden als op dit moment. Meer zo dan de Cubacrisis  in 1962. Mijn voorstel is om de regeringsleiders van de lidstaten van de Europese Unie er niet aflatend toe te bewegen om internationale, en wat mij betreft ook nationale, politieke beslissingen door de leiders van de Europese Unie te laten nemen. Zij moeten de Europese  Unie meer macht schenken en daardoor de EU ook een machtiger speler in de internationale politiek maken. 
Ook ben ik er voorstander van om de 24 talen die de Europese Unie telt terug te brengen naar zes of zeven. Ik denk aan een hoofdtaal voor de EU en aan Europese Regiotalen. Bijvoorbeeld: één hoofdtaal, een voor noordwest Europa, zuidwest Europa, en drie of vier talen voor oost Europa van noordoost, midden-oost en zuidoost Europa. Het verminderen van de Europese talen zou zonder dwang moeten gebeuren; een soort urgent natuurlijk proces.

It was cold and dark outside. When I passed over the usual small bridge that crosses over another bicycle pathway, two hooded high-school age boys from what I could see probably Dutch-Moroccan origin, just finished throwing firework from the bridge on the bicycle path below. The fireworks were strong and loud firecrackers and when they went off I felt the bridge tremble. When I looked below I saw that a man on a bicycle just missed the firecracker while cycling there. The boys were laughing and looked ready for another attempt to throw something down below. I wanted to do something to avoid innocent cyclists from getting fireworks in their clothes or being hurt, but was late for my train and already in a quick pace and the boys looked pretty daunting. What if they had knives or would throw the fireworks at me instead? I quickly checked on my phone but also could not really find the right number to call the police for such matters. I felt helpless and also a bit afraid of the situation.

Wer traut sich, unbequeme Wahrheiten zu transportieren?

A lesser-qualified male was recently hired for the overall tech lead role, in lieu of a better-qualified, and more experienced woman, with a track record of success.   The sexism and bias at Volt is denied by the board, and there is no recourse for those who suffer from discrimination.  As a consequence, it's become more of a progressive gentleman's club, which reflects European politics, sadly.  Women are shamed for speaking up.","Volt needs internal reform, and must walk the talk on DEI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)",Very negative,0.999999,,,,0.000001,,,,0.999999,,,,0.999999,,,,0.490625,0.11606339928057552,0.1160633992805755,0.45134330035971215,0.4325933003597122,,0.09375,0.05491232014388492,0.054912320143884925,0.8787938399280576,0.06629383992805754,,0.3,0.4937612410071942,0.4937612410071942,0.4531193794964029,0.053119379496402885,,0.3625,0.05131519784172667,0.051315197841726674,0.6118424010791367,0.33684240107913666,,0.8902027027027027,0.08956393558860298,0.2533783783783784,0.8323475080700838,,"The best we have, but badly in need of reform along with expansion.","Shared values, together with a lot of problems from a brutal past.

Alsof de regels niet door onszelf en in Europa zijn gemaakt. Opmerkelijk is ook dat iedereen zich vervolgens uitsluitend op de veestapel stort, alsof de industrie en transporteurs zoals Schiphol niet een enorme bijdrage leveren aan het stikstofprobleem. Wat is de bijdrage aan de samenleving door Tatasteel, als zij enerzijds een subsidie krijgen op de energiebelasting en anderzijds de levensduur van de omwonenden negatief beïnvloeden. Waarom is Schiphol zo groot, als de voordelen van de hubfunctie aantoonbaar afwezig zijn. Waarom wordt het slotsysteem niet aangepast, nu het een relikwie is uit de vorige eeuw. Het verkalkt de marktwerking, houdt nieuwkomers tegen en zorgt ervoor dat de KLM en andere gevestigde maatschappijen liever met lege vliegtuigen opstijgen om maar de slots te behouden. Ons oppervlakte is het slechtste van Europa. Ik geloof dat slechts 1% ervan aan de eisen voldoen. Door de onnodige omvang van Schiphol kunnen we 10.000 woningen niet realiseren in Zuid- en Noord Holland. Ik ben juist voor marktwerking en ben daarom van mening dat dit soort subsidies kritisch tegen het licht gehouden moet worden.

The developments in the US offer a glimpse into the type of oligarchy, cronyism, and corruption that awaits us here in Europe as well. I feel that with social media and billionaires, Russia and China spreading misinformation and propaganda, all we can influence is our direct environment, people in our immediate communities. I am disheartened by the lack of willingness to engage, listen, accept other people's viewpoints. I understand how many people feel nobody is listening to them, and I would really like to help with that. When you listen to people, without judgment, they open up and like feeling heard. I just do not know how sustainable any of this is.
The specific experience: I ended up in hospital in Austria, and I shared my room with two women I would never have met in my normal life. Both voted for the FPÖ (far right) in the last elections. These were the first people I have ever met who said they voted for that party, and I was a little shocked. They were nice, reasonable, friendly women who tried to make their lives work and who were concerned about the state of the country. They felt that nobody is interested in them and nobody would listen anyway. I did not start fights with them, I just listened and let them explain to me what they thought was the point in elections, in voting for the FPÖ, how they did not take the racism (and homophobia etc.) too seriously, how they felt they had no other choice. It opened my eyes to see they were compassionate and intelligent people and not the dumb racist nazis I had expected these voters to be. I will not vote far right ever, but I know better than to demonise the people we can still reach.

Dort werde ich immer wieder bedrängt, Rechenschaft zu geben über meine Herkunft, meine Lebensumstände, warum ich gerade dorthin ziehe, was ich dort will und warum ich nicht wo anders hin gehe. Dabei werden auch immer wieder falsche Anschuldigungen, Beleidigungen, Drohungen und Sexismus gegen mich vorgebracht, allesamt von den Einheimischen und fast nur von Älteren ab ca. 50 Jahren. Wenn ich dann begreife, was die von mir denken und womit die mir drohen, trifft es mich jedes Mal wie ein Stromschlag. Ich picke hier nur mal eine Episode mit einer Nachbarin als Beispiel heraus:

Eine Nachbarin, zeigte sich anfangs vergleichsweise freundlich, verabredete sich mit mir. Sie erzählte von sich, lachte über meinen Geburtstag in der ""Walpurgisnacht"" am 30. April  und hörte mir zu.  Bis sie nach einigen Monaten anfing in freundlichem Erzählton antisemitische Aussagen über mich zu machen: An meiner Kleidung fehle eine ""Brosche"", zwei Dreiecke und die am Besten in Sonnenblumengelb. Oder sie empfahl mir mehrfach, die Wege hinter den Häusern am Rande der Siedlung möglichst weit entlangzuwandern. Die fände sie besonders im Frühling genau passend für mich, egal ob ich nach links oder rechts gehen würde, was ich da erlebe, fände ich bestimmt das Absolute und Höchste in meinem Leben. Ich dachte an schöne Natur und Aussichtspunkte, bis ich herausfand, daß sie die Nazi-Routen zur Räumung der Lager im April 1945 meinte. Nach links ging es zu den Arbeitslagern und nach rechts führten die brutalen oft tödlichen Märsche über den Harz. Es gibt noch mehr solcher Beispiele. Ich versuche sie inzwischen zu meiden, räumliche Distanz zu ihr zu halten.

Aber nach dem letzten Jahreswechsel hatte ich gleich am ersten Arbeitstag etwas bei der Post zu erledigen. Da standen wir hintereinander in der  Warteschlange. Sie war stark erkältet, sah grau und krank aus. Ich war lediglich höflich, grüßte sie und wünschte ihr automatisch ein schönes Neues Jahr. Sie nieste und schniefte und antwortete, so gut wären ihre aktuellen Informationen nicht, daß Sie noch auf Schönes hoffe.  Ich fragte, ob es wegen der Erkältung sei. Im Anschluß wollte ich selber zur Apotheke gehen und bot ihr an, ihr ein Medikament mitzubringen. Sie antwortete, wieso Apotheke? Sie sind noch da.","Hass und Neid auf alles, was sie nicht von klein auf zu respektieren gelernt haben oder zu ihrem persönlichen Vorteil manipulieren und ausschlachten können.",,,,,,,1,,,1,,1,,,Very negative,0.74,,,,0.9,,,,0.98,,,,0.999999,,,,0.50625,0.37859712230215825,0.37859712230215825,0.3044514388489209,0.31695143884892085,,0.7875,0.23830935251798557,0.23830935251798557,0.09334532374100724,0.6683453237410072,,0.30625,0.44334526885327674,0.44334526885327674,0.47207736557336166,0.08457736557336165,,0.503125,0.08363309352517989,0.08363309352517989,0.45505845323741,0.46130845323741015,,0.6080235919436893,0.3440211787758596,0.2517454559738572,0.8755274431518105,,"ein Laden mit vielen großen und kleinen Dosen.

Door onszelf (de kiezer) zitten wij (ook internationaal) opgescheept met rechts radicale politici die klein en populistisch denken en beslissingen nemen over zaken als migratie in zondebok termen. Fout! Maar, in mijn ogen: het is de kiezer die slecht geïnformeerd is of bewust wordt misgeïnformeerd. Nu zitten wij met veel te weinig politici die niet strategisch kunnen denken. Dit raakt ons. Alle Europese landen - zelfs Duitsland of Frankrijk- zijn te klein om een deuk in een pakje boter te slaan t.o.v.  de VS en China. Alleen als landen met elkaar samenwerken in bijvoorbeeld Europees verband (maar kan ook anders en breder) staan wij sterk. De EU is tool nummer 1, maar nationale parlementen laten zichzelf verlammen en verlammen ook weer de EU. Dit is probleem nummer 1. Zonder een sterke en samenwerkende EU worden wij internationaal speelbal ipv speler en zal onze rechtstaat, vrijheid en economie afhangen van andere wereldspelers. Lekker.

El gasoducto del oeste de España pasa a poco más de un kilómetro de la población. Una empresa de esas que están surgiendo a raíz de la fiebre del biogás, moderna versión de esos otros episodios de ""fiebre del oro"" que han ocurrido en la Historia, se ha fijado en éste y otros muchos pequeños pueblos para instalar una de esas planta de biogás. En esta región, como en Castilla- la Mancha, Castilla y León, Andalucía,  etc, son muchos los pueblecitos amenazados con ese tipo de instalaciones, situadas en muchos casos, como el de nuestro pueblo, a algo más de un kilómetro del núcleo urbano.  Desgraciadamente las autoridades locales ven en ellas una fuente de ingresos para las arcas municipales por las tasas que estas empresas tendrán que pagar al Ayuntamiento, pero los perjuicios que van a ocasionar a la población no serán compensados por esos ingresos. Creemos que estas plantas van a acabar definitivamente con  estos pequeños pueblos que en los últimos años habían experimentado un cambio de tendencia en el problema de la despoblación y estaban viendo cómo nuevos pobladores los elegían para instalarse en ellos a vivir sus vidas. Sobre todo vivimos con el terror de la amenaza de las nefastas macrogranjas. Estas pueden instalarse hasta  a dos kilómetros de los centros de población. Nos sentimos desamparados, pues los dos grandes partidos políticos y sus autoridades locales en general son entusiastas de este tipo de instalaciones. En nuestro caso Podemos es el único partido que simpatiza con nosotros y ha hecho alguna intervención en la Asamblea de Extremadura para promover el examen y la discusión de esta nueva tecnología y la actual prácticamente inexistente legislación para regularla. Agradeceríamos que cualquier otro partido político se fijara en este asunto y promoviera su discusión.

1977: de geboorte van de Moeder’s Geuren bloemenwierook.

Empowerment, een baan, veiligheid en hoop voor vrouwen, avant la lettre.

In 1977 waren er geen banen voor vrouwen. Er was voor een vrouw alleen werk in de huishouding. 
Een vrouw mocht na haar trouwen niet meer werken (zoals heel vroeger in Nederland).
Bij ons atelier mochten ze vaak van hun man blijven werken omdat het bij ons vrouw-veilig is.
En bij ons kregen de vrouwen hoop op een beter bestaan, vooral voor hun kinderen.

En onze wierook was biologisch, handgerold en duurzaam.
Alle wierooksoorten in India werden geurloos thuis gerold en later werden de stokjes in een fabriek gedipt (de dip methode) in een wierookolie verdund tot zelfs 7 tot 10 keer met ftalaten, die nu verboden zijn vanwege hormoonverstoringen. 
Bij onze wierook wordt de wierookolie niet verdund, maar direct in het wierookdeeg gebruikt (de masala methode). De wierook kan daarom niet thuis gerold worden en alleen onder toezicht in een atelier. Vandaar de banen die voor vrouwen gecreëerd werden. Toen ik moest vertrekken werkten er rond de 200 vrouwen. 
Nu wordt in India vrijwel alle wierook, vanwege goedkoopte, met een machine ‘gerold’. Een machine, afhankelijk van de grootte, kan het rollen overnemen van 50 tot 200 vrouwen. 
Wij blijven echter met de hand rollen. 

Een leuk weetje is dat de verpakking van de wierook bestaat uit handgemarmerd papier, waardoor elk pakje sinds 1977 uniek is: een uniek cadeau gemaakt door vrouwen.

Ik spreek uit eigen HBO ervaring, als docent bij twee totaal verschillende hogescholen. Afkomstig uit de praktijk zie ik hoe schijnbaar ongrijpbaar inefficient en helaas ook niet in met het maatschappelijk belang voorop het er aan toe gaat.

Ik kom zelf uit de praktijk en zie dat het binnen het HBO meer om procedures , structuur en kennis van schrijvers van lesboeken lijkt te gaan dan de nuttige kennis uit de wetenschap en praktijk. Denk ook aan lessons learned e.d. 
HBO's beoordelen elkaar om zo de kwaliteit te borgen. De organisaties waarvoor wordt opgeleid spelen maar een marginale rol. 

Het systeem creëert een eigen werkelijkheid. Als het proces gevolgd is, staat de uitkomst niet meer ter discussie. Een praktisch voorbeeld is dat de binding met student zou moeten komen uit strenge regels in de klas, wat met droge ogen wordt verkondigd. De structuur wint het van de passie voor de student.
En zoals bijvoorbeeld de hype gericht op 'vaardigheden'. De vaardigheid 'samenwerken' maakt dat bijna alle toetsing groepswerk is. Belangrijk, maar flauw gezegd: het is lekker snel nakijken. En de student werkt niet samen, maar men verdeelt alleen onderling de taken.

Het HBO systeem is niet nutteloos, maar het kan veel, veel efficiënter. 

Een concreet verbetervoorbeeld: 
Stage bij Bedrijfskunde is er pas in jaar 2, als de student geluk heeft. Bij de HvA is dat iets wat nog onderzocht wordt, want daar is dat pas verplicht in jaar 3. En dat terwijl al mijn collega's het erover eens zijn dat de studenten pas na stage begrijpen wat we als docent onderwijzen en dat studenten daarna veel meer interesse tonen en het 'pakken'.

Ik pleit voor gelijktijdige stage en theorie. Vanaf het eerste jaar. En dan iedere paar maanden een andere stage, in een zo verschillend mogelijke organisatie.
voordelen: 
- directe koppeling met praktijk, ipv bedacht door mijn collega's met afstand tot de praktijk.
- in klaslokalen vind de uitwisseling plaats op basis van de nieuwste inzichten
- studenten dragen al eerder bij een de maatschappij
- studenten weten jaren eerder wat ze willen na hun studie, wat er bij ze past
- studenten begrijpen waar ze voor leren; dit motiveert: meer aandacht van de student, sneller leercurve, beter begrip en veel minder uitval in de eerste twee jaar, wat nu de helft (!) van de studenten betreft.

Kortom kwaliteit en plezier omhoog en kosten omlaag!

Nog een voorbeeld: de student aantallen lopen fors terug, nieuwe docenten worden niet aangenomen, maar Windesheim Almere staat op het punt nieuwbouw te gaan plegen in het centrum van Almere. Dat dient in alle eerlijkheid ego's en niet het maatschappelijk belang. Dat kost geld dat niet naar het onderwijs zelf gaat.

Opgegroeid in een ondernemersgezin, vanaf 15e meegewerkt rechten gestudeerd en vervolgens bij kleine en hele grote organisaties gewerkt. Een paar jaar geleden ben ik docent geworden bij HBO Bedrijfskunde. Eerst bij een kleine en recent bij een hele grote HBO opleiding.

That is why I became a member Volt while still living in Canada. At the moment I am in transit between Canada and the Netherlands; due to personal circumstances I can no longer work full-time and I'm obliged to avoid the slippery conditions of Canadian winters by living in Holland during that time. In the course of the next three years I will gradually transition to the Netherlands permanently. Unfortunately, I have found it rather difficult to get in touch with other members of Volt in my community. As far as a person of my generation is concerned, the emphasis Volt places on computer literacy is perhaps overly optimistic, especially as I am a person with certain physical challenges, notably in terms of fine motor skills. I find it difficult enough to keep abreast of basic developments within the world of smart phones and computers and often feel that both expects more of me on this front than I can realistically achieve. I appreciate however that my personal situation is quite complex. Nonetheless I think it would be very helpful if all had a ""helpdesk"" for those who, like me, find it difficult to chart a course on their own through Volt's online presence.

Een gesprek met iemand die tegenover een lagere school woont en zich eraan ergert dat bijna alle kinderen donker gekleurd zijn. Want: zover zijn we al gekomen. Een gesprek met iemand die onderaan de samenleving bungelt en de SP en alle linkse partijen vervloekt. Hoe rechtser hoe beter. 
Je benoemt zijn uitkering, de subsidies, de toeslagen, de opvang. Het helpt niet. De indoctrinatie is zo heftig dat deze mensen niet inzien dat ze er sociaal en maatschappelijk met Wilders en co niet op vooruit gaan. Het is de belangrijkste verschuiving naar een fascistoide politiek. En omdat links wel z'n best doet maar weinig nieuw verhaal heeft ben ik het eens met kamerlid De Hoop dat een nieuwe partij misschien de oplossing is. Maar Volt kan in dat gat springen door minder one issue partij te zijn en vaker uitleg geven in Jip en Janneketaal.

Ik maak deel uit van een initiatief van Toukomst, onderdeel van NPG. De naam van ons initiatief is 't Wad tot Stad', waar Stad voor stad Groningen staat. Toukomst is een burgerinitiatief. Wij hebben het Reitdiep, als drager voor het gebied van Lauwersmeer, Middag Humsterland tot de stad Groningen, gekozen om de cultuurhistorische waarden te beschermen, zonder het gebied op slot te zetten voor inwoners, ondernemers en boeren. Ons initiatief sluit goed aan bij wat de drie gemeenten in het gebied voor ogen staat, inclusief het Waterschap en de Provincie Groningen. Het sluitstuk van ons werk is het ontwikkelen van een Landschapsvisie, die zo breed mogelijk gedragen wordt.

Spannend is hoe de landelijke politiek (de BBB in de huidige regering) zich in de komende tijd opstelt, want het kabinetsbeleid gaat mede de kaders vormen voor verdere uitwerking van de Landschapsvisie.

Ik worstel enorm met deze X beslissing...
In eerste instantie: ""Yes boycotten dat X!""
Het is een bizar platform geworden en Facebook gaat er achter aan.....


Tegelijkertijd,  
a. willen we echt dat iedereen zich terugtrekt op zijn eigen platform om alleen nog de gewenste dingen te horen? 
b. wie geeft er dan nog tegen geluid?  Een ander inzicht op de materie voor de miljoenen die wel blijven hangen? 
c. de framing/ observatie van MM is nu dat de linkse elite echt niet begrijpt wat er onder normale burgers speelt.. op een eigen platform terugtrekken bevestigd dat beeld en maakt elkaar begrijpen nog lastiger (beetje 'Amerikaanse toestanden' met 2 tegenovergestelde partijen) 
d. wij Volters, als echte democraten, gaan prat op vrijheid van meningsuiting. Dus waarom kritisch zijn op een platform die dat faciliteert?
e. niet fact checken: is dat slecht? Ik vind van wel maar/ echter..... wie checkt de fact checker? Staatsmedia agenten?  'Onafhankelijke' (onbekende? ) journalisten/experts? Wie dan?  
Dus ik twijfel wat beter is.

She was born in what is now Bielorussia and I have cousins living in Poland and Lithuania.
I have worked all my life to maintain peace in Europe, seeing the Commission where I work as ""The institution which maintains ideals alive "" (Jean Monnet, in his memoirs)  and was completely taken by surprise by Putin's aggression to Ukraine. On 24/2/24 I was in the heart of Europe, where I organised on Rond-Point Schuman, in front of the Berlaymont a demonstration with hundreds of Commission colleagues. The following day 20.000 Belgians demonstrated in Brussels.
Three years later I am working to ""widen the Overton window"" so that Belgians first, EUropeans then understand and prepare for sending troop in Ukraine to defend the ceasefire that, I hope, will come soon.

Specifiek voor ondernemers zijn er grote en bijna onhaalbare uitdagingen. Niet de markt is het probleem, want die is er wel, zeker als je naar de EU kijkt. Maar lokaal in Nederland spelen veel tegenwerkende zaken voor ondernemers  1: de slechte verkrijgbaarheid van ruimte om uit te breiden, 2: de onzekere en op dit moment negatieve positie van de energieleverantie ( netwerk) waardoor expansie vaak niet mogelijk is, 3: de steeds wisselende policy van de overheid als het gaat om de energietransitie waardoor ondernemers geen maatregelen durven te nemen 4: de ongelofelijk grote bureaucratie ondanks dat vele kabinetten al 20 jaar lang roepen dat men die druk gaat verminderen 5: Het feit dat Nederland zich aan de zelfde uitstoot- en energietransitieregels moet houden als heel de EU , wetend dat ons land veel drukker bevolkt is dan welk ander land binnen de EU.  Hierdoor kunnen veel bedrijven niet of heel moeilijk werken. De situatie is hoofdzakelijk ontstaan omdat Nederland ondanks de eindeloze EU regeldrift toch altijd een voorbeeldfunctie heeft willen bekleden.   Ondernemers lijden hieronder.",EU moet beter gaan begrijpen dat Nederland op dit moment niet aan alle klimaatregels kan voldoen.

Throughout the world, and in Europe, we see a rise to power of right-wing populist parties. The opinions and views they represent often are extremist, anti-democratic, anti-environment and anti-inclusivity. But somehow these populist and anti-democratic voices are more easy heard, and accepted by, what seems to be, a growing number of people. And how come this is not being met with a strong response by the left wing, or more progressive and inclusive parties? Why does the idea take place that the sound of the future is dominated by the shouting of the right wing populist? I think that parties (like Volt) miss the translation of making their voice and message be heard and felt on the streets. We (as Volt memnber) need to maximise our effort to reacht the people in the street, and make our message clear and relevant to everyone. One of the key insights from a local right wing politician I read in the newspaper; is that this person is approachable, talks to the people in the streets, drives around in a car with his phone numer written on it, and he actually pick up the phone and listens! In order to win the vote, we need to break down the 'Europe for all' idealogy and make it super tangible and utterly relevant to the people in the local community.

Des panneaux photovoltaiques trônent sur les toits. 
Je laisse mes quelques ares de jardin en friche et y réintroduis des espèces végétales indigènes de ma région. J'achète mes produits laitiers à une ferme toute proche. Je me fais livrer des produits du terroir. 
J'ai vu au cours de ma vie les grands distributeurs tuer, pied à pied, le commerce local, celui qui faisait société. Aujourd'hui, ils jouent du violon aux oreilles des consommateurs qui sont fatigués de leur credo: ""l'économie d'échelle"". Ils se mettent à mimer l'épicerie de quartier qu'ils avaient bannie quelques décennies plus tôt. C'est un leurre. Une seule religion prévaut: le profit. Le prix est devenu l'unique argument de vente au détriment de la qualité, de la durabilité, de la santé. Les producteurs sont étranglés.
Je fais ma part, mais ça me paraît infime à côté de ce qu'il y a à faire pour retourner à un minimum d'humanité et de lien social.
L'Europe doit être unie sous peine de se faire écraser. Mais elle doit doit être unie autour de projets plus régionalisés. On déplace des montagnes avec de la cohésion sociale. Le néolibéralisme qui conduit la mondialisation détruit le lien et l'essence-même de l'humanité.
Volt m'intéresse par l'aspect transfrontalier et j'aime aussi entendre que vous avez une approche qui respecte les spécificités régionales. 
Les gens en perte d'identité qui voient en l'extrême-droite une porte de sortie m'effraient. A quel niveau de privation de libertés, de mortifications de la culture  sont-ils capables d'adhérer? Le devoir de mémoire ne suffit plus. Il faut relever toutes les atteintes aux droits de l'homme qui vont avec les dictatures. Les USA nous montrent la voie à ne pas suivre... Avons-nous failli? Nos enfants ne sont-ils plus élevés dans l'esprit des lumières? Est-ce le ras-de-marée digital qui est en train de détruire le moteur-même de nos démocraties: l'analyse contradictoire? 
Est-il possible de retrouver d'autres valeurs que la seule recherche de profit? Avons-nous, à ce point, oublié que nous sommes mortels et que l'accumulation de biens est vaine dès lors que nous pouvons nous loger, nous nourrir, nous vêtir, nous chauffer.
Peut-on encore compter sur le monde politique pour enrayer le dérèglement climatique? La mobilisation citoyenne semble aujourd’hui plus convaincante. Si on ne peut plus influencer les décideurs, il faut agir au niveau du tendon d'Achille: la consommation qui nourrit la puissance de ceux qui acquièrent de plus en plus de monopoles. On veut dynamiser une économie? En quoi favoriser les grosses entreprises et les monopoles peut-il encourager à entreprendre? Créer des start-up empêche-t-il qu'elles finissent revendues à des gros groupes qui les phagocytent pour devenir toujours plus puissants?
J'ai grandi avec le mantra: ""l'économie s'autorégule grâce au principe de l'offre et de la demande""... Ce n'est plus trop d'actualité. Si on laisse une entreprise devenir un mastodonte qui prend toutes les parts de marché, où est l'autorégulation. Plus de PME qui se concurrencent, n'est-ce pas cela, dynamiser l'économie?

Geen Twitter en Facebook meer (Meta moet helemaal de deur uit maar van WhatsApp afkomen is nog niet zo eenvoudig, qua werk etc.), en geen Amazon meer en ik moet de-Googlen (ook nog niet zo eenvoudig, want qua werk etc.). Naast de moeilijkheden die het opwerpen van een dam tegen fascisme ondervindt door de (bijna traditionele) onderlinge verdeeldheid van alles wat er zich ter linkerzijde van Atilla de Hun bevindt, wordt het extra bemoeilijkt door het feit dat we er steeds minder een gedeelde realiteit op nahouden.

Met al lange tijd met mijn beperking, kreeg ik een hersenbloeding in Kroatië waar ik toen woonde. Hoewel men dit nooit dacht was de behandeling daar geweldig, echt top. Maar hoorde ik later, voor de Kroaten had dit toen nooit zo goed gewerkt. Let wel, ik was nog steeds NL ingezetene. Er moet één reis en ziektekostenverzekering komen voor HÉÉL Europa, er mag op vlak van gezondheid geen verschil zijn zoals in de VS en haar staten.

Omdat ik de Balkan zeer goed ken, veel mensen leren kennen in 10 jaar aldaar. Maar al in 19999, o mijn eerste trip, hoorde ik al van taxichauffeurs dat zij verwachtten ooit weer on Russisch juk te komen, en 10 jaar later dachten ze dat nog steeds ook met NATO lidmaatschap.

Jag anser detta vara en stor brist i dagens EU som bl a ges oss EUR medborgare rätt till att vistas och arbeta i ett annat EU land. När vi flyttade har vi alltså inte kunnat ta med våra demokratiska rättigheter och därmed inte kunnat välja politiker som skulle kunna föra vår talan i den politiska instans som bestämmer över bla hur våra skattepengar används. Man skall som EU medborgare inte behöva bli (i vårt fall) svensk medborgare och därmed (i vårt fall) avsäga sitt nederländska medborgarskap för att fullt ut kunna delta i alla demokratiska val i det EU land där man bor, arbetar och betalar skatt.

Er ontstond een gesprekje over huizenprijzen, schaarste en vandaar ging het naar algemenere politieke onderwerpen. We belandden bij landbouw en veeteelt, en hij zei ""maar ja, een boerderij is in feite gewoon natuur"". Waarna ik zei dat dat in de oorsprong wellicht waar is geweest maar nu allang niet vanwege schaalvergroting, kunstmest, kunstmatig geoptimaliseerd veevoer, mestuitstoot en natuurlijk stikstof (waardoor oa de woningnood toe is genomen vanwege een probleem met vergunningverlening).

a. the situation in Gaza , Westbank etc. Especially the behaviour of Netan and his Yahus,     IDF et al. The proven criminal behaviour belongs in the ICC but geopolitcal interests seem to prevent this and moreover my second point below has driven middle east a bit into the shadow.

b. the situation in the USA which is basically a developing copy of NAZI Germany. I  find the political environment which tries   to deal with the Trump administration as if its normal, truly disturbing. The situation there, including the influence of Musk, is truly dangerous geopolitically. Including the Russian agression and a possible axis USA,Russia, NorthKorea

Thirdly there are some less democratic tendencies here in the netherlands, but on the geopolitical scene these are neight unimportant.

I am learning more about regenerative farming as a solution of carbonstorage and reduction of nitrogen emission.  Why don't we use this in NL to solve our N2 problem? Why is there no way for carbon sequestration in the EU?

Sie wurde ganz klar professionell angelegt, mit extra betonnierter Laderampe. Mit einem Freund habe ich versucht, von der Gemeinde Aufklärung darüber zu bekommen. Eine Wand des Schweigens: ""Wir wissen darüber nichts"". Ein Artikel in der Zeitung führte nur zu Kommentaren  nach dem Tenor: Was will der Ausländer hier? Auch eine Beschwerde bei der EU in Brüssel brachte nichts: ""Wir haben die zuständigen Behörden gebeten, sich darum zu kümmern...""Es gab von keiner Seite Versuche, diese hunderte Tonnen Müll, die zudem bei Starkregen einen Strand bedrohen, zu beseitigen. ""Kein Geld"".
Dann gab es eine andere Bürgeraktion: Protest gegen eine geplante Windfarm in den Bergen. In einem Naturschutzgebiet (in dem übrigens auch die Mülldeponie gelegen ist) Plötzlich konnte eine Unterschriftensammlung tausende Unterschriften dagegen bekommen, um die ""Zerstörung der Umwelt"" zu verhindern.
Fazit für mich: Wenn es um etwas geht, bei dem jemand vor Ort womöglich finanziell betroffen sein könnte. dann schweigen alle.

Bij de kassa vroeg een jonge vrouw aan een oudere dame of ze haar hond bij zich kon houden, zodat hij niet aan haar kon snuffelen. De teckel was druk bezig met het inspecteren van de schoenen van de jongere vrouw.

Na een kort gesprek over de reden van het verzoek en de opmerking van de oudere vrouw dat ""mijn hond is schoon; hij slaapt zelfs in mijn bed,"" begon ze een zin met ""jullie."" Helaas kan ik me de rest van die zin niet meer herinneren. Ik vroeg de oudere vrouw wat ze precies met ""jullie"" bedoelde. De jongere vrouw droeg een lange chique jas en had een hoofddoek op.

De jongere vrouw bedankte me en vroeg of haar verzoek om de hond op afstand te houden verkeerd was. Ik antwoordde dat dit niet het geval was. Daarna verliet ze de winkel, terwijl de oudere vrouw mopperend haar aankopen betaalde en wegging.

Ik liep ook weg, maar heb nu spijt dat ik niet duidelijker stelling had genomen over het gebruik van ""jullie,"" alsof ""we"" superieur zouden zijn.

I discussed with many people, those that are political active, or simply aware, and those of the large majority who have real world daily problems that they describe quite bluntly.

It struck me that none of the classic parties cater for that majority, they play only for their own small constituenty except for that ultra right wing party, that manages to speak the language of the people and talk about daily problems (a real drug problem in the streets of our small town, a huge crime raise... ) and about the measures they would take to... behave like Trump 

It is very difficult to convince a member of the majority whose 18 year old daughter is harassed on the street by ""immigrants"" that the ultra right is not the answer, certainly while normal parties are deaf and blind for his fear and anger, even refuse to mention it or listen to him...

Sie geht aktuell in die 1. Klasse einer Regelschule. Dort ist sie eines von zahlreichen Kindern mit Förderschwerpunkt. Diese inklusive Beschulung ist aus unserer Sicht für unsere Tochter die beste Lösung, da sie ihr die Möglichkeit gibt, ihr volle Potenzial auszuschöpfen, was bei Kindern mit Förderschwerpunkt (besonders bei „GE“-Kindern = geistige Entwicklung) immer schwer zu ermitteln ist. Viele GE Kinder gehen daher in ein Förderzentrum und werden getrennt von gesunden Kindern beschult. Das sorgt zum einen dafür, dass manche Potentiale betroffener Kinder niemals gefördert werden und sie stets unterfordert bleiben, was ihre Zukunftschancen mindert. Zum Anderen verfestigt es die deutsche Praxis, überdurchschnittlich viele Kinder in Sonderschulen zu betreuen. 
Im Falle unserer Tochter war der Weg jedoch in unsere Wunschschule eine große Herausforderung, da es verschiedene Stellen gibt, die die Schulplatzvergabe mit beeinflussen: Schulamt, Jugendamt, Schulen, ggf. SPZs bzw. begutachtende Stellen usw. 
Wie immer kommt es am Ende auf Geeignetheit und Verfügbarkeit an. Hier liegt leider das eigentliche Problem: zu wenige Schulen haben entsprechende personelle und infrastrukturelle Ausstattungen sowie die notwendige Erfahrung Schülerinnen und Schüler aufzunehmen. Hier ist aber die Nachfrage viel größer als das Angebot. Mein Plädoyer für mehr Stellen für Sonderpädagoginnen/-Pädagogen in den Schulen in Verbindung mit mehr Schulhelfern.

To be so young and have such a high mortgage to start seems so unreasonable. This not only the story of my family, but is the case for most young people in the Netherlands.

Being candidate for Regional in 2021 wasn’t easy at all, facing how citizens were pretty disgusted. Too many critics or pretexts about our community places for poor results from them. Boulogne, a town dead. That’s all they’re able to say without reconsider our potential and open their minds to the world we are building.

Boulogne-sur-Mer area is underrated, concentrated to fish industry and Nausicaá whilst it has the potential to be a better and powerful place between London and Brussels.  The town and its areas suffered from wars, the French State and local officers have no will to make it richer and rethink its attractiveness. I’m really concerned about the place I live as personal and as visitor. When I travel elsewhere in Europe and the UK, It feels like you’ve find your way back to the world of civilization after being lost in the forest. 

Since always, Europe makes sense for a lot of things and although the National Rally (Antoine Golliot and Christine Engrand) won Boulonnais constituencies in 2024, Europe is important for the prosperity and the well-being of the Boulonnais people. 

Under the French centralism rule, our territory cannot express itself with its lack of emancipation because it’s considered as a territory in the North of Paris rather than in the heart of Europe.

To make our territory “Great Again” in a better way than our lil’bro USA, it needs to be more autonomous, sharing a special status within France and the EU at the same time, based on examples such as Åland, an associated-state with Finland. The main idea is to make the Boulonnais an European Laboratory for experiencing both EU and French public policies, close to the UK Post-Brexit. 

Thanks to the Autonomy, and the ability to have a wide and full competencies, with legislative bodies, we’ll be able to help our people and inspire others that EU works by having power to legislate, handle refugees crisis with more humanity, responds to floods, diversifying our economies through AI or decarbonization researches and develop Free trade zone to enhance our bound with Britain and Benelux, better transportation system with our neigbors, recognize Boulonnais/Picard , Dutch, English and French at the same level and not only French as sole language and Boulonnais/Picard as wrong French... Why not having an extended welfare system and more democracy, flex security inspired by other european countries.

That idea came a long time ago with aim to make Boulogne and the Boulonnais a better place to live in the 21st century, respond to crisis with neighbors, EU and State and set one step further to the foundation of the United States of Europe and perhaps, the Boulonnais will not become member, but just European State.

De avond was georganiseerd door een dame die verbonden is aan de ontmoetingsplek. Zij heeft enige tijd geleden hulp gehad van de auteur bij het overwinnen van een angst voor honden. Toen bleek dat deze meneer een leuk boek geschreven had over honden en baasjes besloot zij een avond te organiseren waarbij de bewuste persoon geïnterviewd zou worden, mensen vragen konden stellen en eventueel het boek konden kopen.

Niet omdat ik niet meer geloof of sta voor waar Volt op gebouwd is. In het begin was het heel simpel; Rechtvaardigheid, Gelijkwaardigheid, Duurzaamheid en Solidariteit, en dat kun je niet alleen, dus minimaal op Europees niveau. Het begon zo mooi, en inmiddels zijn we op alle niveaus vertegenwoordigd. De reden dat ik gestopt ben is simpel, inmiddels is hetzelfde gedrag dat ik zo veroordeel gewoon goed geworden binnen Volt. De manier waarop er omgegaan is met het vertrek van Nilufer, de manier waarop we in Gemeenten waar we meedoen klakkeloos partijen volgen die stelselmatig anderen uitsluiten en de manier waarop we democratische rechten misbruiken om gedrag te rechtvaardigen dat niet te rechtvaardigen is. Hoe we uitzonderingen tot regel willen verheffen. Democratie is geen recht, dat moet je verdienen en helaas soms zelfs voor vechten. Wel aanspraak maken maar zelf niet staan voor het recht van andersdenkenden zorgt niet voor verdraagzaamheid maar voor het verder uiteendrijven van mensen. Begrijp me niet verkeerd, ik sta nog steeds achter de pilaren waarop Volt gebouwd is, maar we nemen de verkeerde afslag. Ik zie Volt steeds vaker in de symptoombestrijding duiken ipv het te hebben over de oorzaken. Een positieve uitzondering is de opstelling rondom defensie, helaas is een krachtig militair apparaat noodzakelijk. Maar als je iets aan het klimaat wilt doen dan moet je de oorzaak aanpakken, 120 miljoen mensen in China die in armoede leven of kijken naar kinderarmoede in het algemeen. Terwijl onze goed opgeleide kinderen op de snelweg gaan zitten, leven er volgens Unicef nog steeds 300 miljoen kinderen in extreme armoede. Welk argument zou ik moeten gebruiken om deze mensen de kans te ontnemen om te proberen die armoede te ontvluchten? En dan het vrouwen quota, ik zou niets liever zien dan meer vrouwen in de politiek, maar in de huidige wereld, gedreven door social media en big data en geregeerd door mannen die weinig hebben met gelijkheid zie je het omgekeerde. Gedreven door wat de algoritmes brengen worden vrouwen linkser en mannen rechtser. Dus beperk jezelf niet door idealen, Als er mannen zijn die willen, en die in staat zijn om datgene waarvoor we de vrouwen in de politiek nodig hebben ook in te brengen maak daar dan gebruik van, haal niet doel en middel door elkaar.  Mannen en vrouwen zijn niet gelijk en dat is nu juist het mooie, en niet iedereen voelt zich thuis in een hokje man of vrouw en dat is oké, maar we zijn niet allemaal gelijk en dat is nu juist zo mooi. En gelijkwaardigheid dan? Ook die is heel simpel gelijkwaardig ben je alleen als je en ander ook als gelijkwaardige accepteert, gelijkwaardig Heid betekend niet dat iedereen moet vinden of voelen wat jij voelt.","Democracy is not a right you have, you have to earn it, you have to fight for it!",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neutral,0.5,,,,0.000001,,,,0.5,,,,0.999999,,,,0.496875,0.3570705935251799,0.3570705935251799,0.32458970323741015,0.31833970323741007,,0.5,0.3642648381294964,0.3642648381294964,0.3178675809352518,0.3178675809352518,,0.503125,0.673617356115108,0.673617356115108,0.1600663219424461,0.16631632194244605,,0.225,0.15203462230215825,0.15203462230215825,0.6989826888489209,0.14898268884892088,,0.2246621621621622,0.8335416938779319,0.1756756756756757,0.1444964827496128,,"Een kans om verschil te maken, maar nog lang niet goed genoeg",Een smeltkroes van van alles en nog wat waar ik me prima thuis voel,Iets dat je nooit voor vanzelfsprekend mag nemen,"Mijn verhaal is niet belangrijk, luisteren naar andersdenkenden is belangrijk.

Cyprus is supposedly a small island thus the destination to A to B should not take a long time. Instead it might take someone a usual 10-minute ride even an hour, especially when it comes to peak-hours.

Daarna heb ik me gespecialiseerd tot revalidatiearts en in die functie heb ik meer dan 30 gewerkt, werkend met patiënten en revalidatieteams, als opleider en als onderzoeker, meestentijds in de praktijk. Recent ben ik met pensioen gegaan.

Ik ben gelukkig en gezond. ""All my basic needs are fulfilled"", zoals wonen, familie, hobby's, et cetera. Goed pensioen. ""Wat wil je ng meer?"" Bijna iedereen roept me toe: ""nu genieten!"" Tuurlijk; goed bedoeld ook en ik doe dat graag, maar toch...: ik hoef geen camper met fietsen achterop. Ik ga geen wereldreis maken. Ik hoop nog wat jaren te leven en ben nu op een nieuwe manier ""beschikbaar"" voor anderen. Zo geef ik bijvoorbeeld les. En zorg ik voor kleinkinderen. Mijn reportoire als amateur-pianist groeit gestaag.

Echter: hoe maken we in onze maatschappij goed (liefst optimaal natuurlijk) gebruik van het potentieel van de mensen, die niet (of niet meer) actief zijn in hun oorspronkelijke vak (in mijn geval dat van praktiserend arts)? Zeker nu er zoveel tekorten zijn, is het betreurenswaardig, dat er een ""harde knip"" bestaat tussen werken en niet-werkend.
Ik ga mijn weg wel vinden, maar in het algemeen is er weinig georganiseerd op dit vlak. (Als ik het goed zie, haha.)

Erwachsener, lebte und arbeitete ich in Deutschland.
Älterer Mensch, ich sehe wieviel Jugendliche quer durch die Grenzen innerhalb der EU studieren, wie sie grenzenlos kommunizieren.
Ich denke, dass die nationalen Staaten aus meiner Kindheit in der EU noch weiterleben, nur teilweise vernünftig vereint, obwohl sie für die jungen Erwachsenen und die von morgen gar nicht mehr die richtigen politischen Rahmen bilden. Diese europäisch wachsenden jungen Menschen sind sich ihrer politischen Macht und des Werts ihrer Erfahrung noch nicht bewusst. Gut, dass es VOLT gibt, um ihnen eine Stimme zu geben.

There is a street bypassing the whole city which would divert the traffic from our street but unfortunately it is not finished. Only about 200m are missing, but they are on the private ground of the factory and the factory does not want to pay for completing it. I asked the major if she could do something so that the missing part of the street, but she said that the factory is very important for the city as tax payer and employer of 200 persons.

The European Commission, who is not supposed to be a politically motivated actor, is giving in to political and lobby pressure in the name of ""simplification"" and ""competitiveness"". Despite previous assurances that simplification would not lead to deregulation and that the EU’s sustainability goals would remain intact, they are introducing significant changes that constitute a major setback for transparency, accountability, sustainable finance, not to mention our climate and environmental goals. They are even starting to attack NGOs' involvement in the policymaking process, which would be an enormous blow to our democratic participation. It feels like the vultures are circling and we are trying our best to do as much damage control as we can, but we are heading for a massive deregulation. The global political context, in particular everything that is happening in the USA, seems to have uprooted the goalposts.

Auf einer Fachtagung habe ich kürzlich wieder eindrücklich erlebt, woran diese Idee scheitert. Zum einen sind die meisten Menschen fest in Rollen und Strukturen eingebunden und verorten sich bewusst für ""ihre"" Aufgabe, ""ihr"" Anliegen und ""ihr"" Ziel. Es ist ihnen nicht möglich oder erscheint für sie nicht schlüssig, das eigene Vorhaben auch systemisch zu betrachten - selbst wenn sie im Sinne des Allgemeinwohls aktiv werden. Hier greift möglicherweise immer noch ein Leistungsverständnis, welches uns diktiert, ""selbst"" und ""allein"" etwas ""zu schaffen"" und keinesfalls Ruhm und Ehre mit anderen zu teilen. Zum anderen ist es tatsächlich schwierig, für ein abstraktes System sprechfähig zu werden oder sich damit zu beauftragen. Allein die Beauftragung, für eine Kooperation im Sinne des Systemwandels zu sprechen, löst häufig starke Abwehrreaktionen und vor allem die Frage nach der Berechtigung aus.

Von einem Tag auf den anderen wurde das ""Gehweg- und Grünflächenparken"" auf dieser sehr langen Straße mit einem Bußgeld von 55 € geahndet. In der ersten Runde wurden 240 Halter mit Bußgeld belegt, insgesamt wurden in wenigen Wochen Bußgelder i.H.v. ca. 50.000 € erhoben. Im ersten Moment habe ich mich gefreut, dass hier endlich durchgegriffen wird. Dann habe ich verstanden, dass das nicht für alle so einfach ist, wie für mich (ich habe einen Stellplatz, aber kein Auto). Dann ging die Diskussion los (Presse, Ortsbeirat, WhatsApp-Gruppe). Insgesamt ist der Ton noch freundlich, aber die Autofahrer-Bubble ist schon echt krass. Hier wird recht schnell mit einem gefühlten Anrecht auf einen kostenfreien Stellplatz im öffentlichen Raum argumentiert und ständig wird die alte, gehbehinderte Dame oder die alleinerziehende Mama mit 7 Kindern als Argument herangezogen.

Zwei Minuten später kommen die beiden aber wieder an mir vorbei, und jetzt sieht es wieder so aus, als würde der Mann die Frau bedrängen. Ich überlege wieder, ob ich eingreifen soll, aber die beiden laufen extrem schnell an mir vorbei und sind schon wieder weg, bevor ich etwas tun kann.

It was very interesting and showed the problem of housing. I never knew that 40% of the houses in this village are secondary homes. Young people have trouble finding a place locally. Mind you, there is also not kuch economic activity, and many young people choose to live in cities these days. There was one person that I found interesting, because he thinks systemically about issues. He was talking about the commons in a way that I hadn't heard before. Many people benefit from the area, it's a great nature tourism place, but all we get back is the money they spend locally. Our thinking is so dominated by money and teh economy. We have to change the way we think about ourselves, our environment, the way we live, the solutions we can find together. The concept of the commons may be brought back to life. What if we manage to renovate the old textile buildings that are now empty, for housing of young people? One person has space to make an apprtment in her house, but she is not doing it, because too many rules and morms will make it costly, and then the rights of the tenants are soo strong, you can never get people out anymore.

All of the town's citizens gathered each year to act as the town's legislative body, debating and making policy decisions.

One of my earliest memories of our Town Meeting had us debating the extension of a regional highway system through our town. I was young, so my perceptions of it at the time were of lots of very opinionated adults being very loud and the discussion being very boring. Now though, a few decades later, it's rather impactful in that day's decisions continues to shape the regional transportation infrastructure... We decided not to allow the highway to pass through the town, and so the highway (Route 25) exists only from the coast through the nearest city, where it abruptly ends and forces you to take local roads until connecting with the next highway a few towns later.

It's impactful to me in the level of long-term power and impact given to a very citizen-level process, while also (again in retrospect) demonstrating some challenges to regional cooperation in a democratic framework.",New England Town Meetings &amp; the Interstate Highway Expansion,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Neutral,0.25,,,,0.17,,,,,,,1,0.51,,,,0.640625,0.4397856348710094,0.4397856348710094,0.1394821825644954,0.4207321825644953,,0.9125,0.16280721760482242,0.16280721760482242,0.0060963911975888685,0.8310963911975888,,0.5,0.6771957617011859,0.6771957617011859,0.16140211914940708,0.16140211914940708,,0.821875,0.2599295746508262,0.2599295746508262,0.04816021267458681,0.6919102126745869,,0.9169482024940284,0.8291681708879982,0.2063625825418008,0.6452624171056516,,N/A,N/A,Everyone working through difficult negotiation to reach consensus.,Anyone interested in experience with direct democracy.,How can we balance direct participation in democratic decision-making with the real/practical needs of regional cooperation and action.,somewhat common,Other,,Male,34 - 54,,I consent to the processing of my data under the privacy policy of Volt Europa A.I.S.B.L. ,446,,,,1744892033683,Chrome,1744892737647,WebCollector 2.4,135,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ChangeNOW25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
